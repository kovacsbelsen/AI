       "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession\n",
       "of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\n",
       "\n",
       "However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his\n",
       "first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds\n",
       "of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property\n",
       "of some one or other of their daughters.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My dear Mr. Bennet,\" said his lady to him one day, \"have you heard that\n",
       "Netherfield Park is let at last?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But it is,\" returned she; \"for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she\n",
       "told me all about it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Bennet made no answer.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Do you not want to know who has taken it?\" cried his wife impatiently.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "This was invitation enough.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken\n",
       "by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came\n",
       "down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much\n",
       "delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he\n",
       "is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to\n",
       "be in the house by the end of next week.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What is his name?\"\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Is he married or single?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or\n",
       "five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How so? How can it affect them?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My dear Mr. Bennet,\" replied his wife, \"how can you be so tiresome! You\n",
       "must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Is that his design in settling here?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he\n",
       "_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as\n",
       "soon as he comes.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send\n",
       "them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are\n",
       "as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the\n",
       "party.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but\n",
       "I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five\n",
       "grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into\n",
       "the neighbourhood.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is more than I engage for, I assure you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would\n",
       "be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to\n",
       "go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no\n",
       "newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to\n",
       "visit him if you do not.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very\n",
       "glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my\n",
       "hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though\n",
       "I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the\n",
       "others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so\n",
       "good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the preference.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"They have none of them much to recommend them,\" replied he; \"they are\n",
       "all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of\n",
       "quickness than her sisters.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Mr. Bennet, how _can_ you abuse your own children in such a way? You\n",
       "take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They\n",
       "are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration\n",
       "these last twenty years at least.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ah, you do not know what I suffer.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four\n",
       "thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not\n",
       "visit them.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them\n",
       "all.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,\n",
       "reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had\n",
       "been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind\n",
       "was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding,\n",
       "little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented,\n",
       "she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her\n",
       "daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.\n",

       "Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He\n",
       "had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring\n",
       "his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was\n",
       "paid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following\n",
       "manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he\n",
       "suddenly addressed her with:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,\" said her mother\n",
       "resentfully, \"since we are not to visit.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But you forget, mamma,\" said Elizabeth, \"that we shall meet him at the\n",
       "assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces\n",
       "of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion\n",
       "of her.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No more have I,\" said Mr. Bennet; \"and I am glad to find that you do\n",
       "not depend on her serving you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain\n",
       "herself, began scolding one of her daughters.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven's sake! Have a little\n",
       "compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,\" said her father; \"she times\n",
       "them ill.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I do not cough for my own amusement,\" replied Kitty fretfully. \"When is\n",
       "your next ball to be, Lizzy?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"To-morrow fortnight.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Aye, so it is,\" cried her mother, \"and Mrs. Long does not come back\n",
       "till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him,\n",
       "for she will not know him herself.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce\n",
       "Mr. Bingley to _her_.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him\n",
       "myself; how can you be so teasing?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I honour your circumspection. A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly\n",
       "very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a\n",
       "fortnight. But if _we_ do not venture somebody else will; and after all,\n",
       "Mrs. Long and her neices must stand their chance; and, therefore, as\n",
       "she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will\n",
       "take it on myself.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, \"Nonsense,\n",
       "nonsense!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?\" cried he. \"Do\n",
       "you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on\n",
       "them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you,\n",
       "Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read\n",
       "great books and make extracts.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"While Mary is adjusting her ideas,\" he continued, \"let us return to Mr.\n",
       "Bingley.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am sick of Mr. Bingley,\" cried his wife.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me that before? If\n",
       "I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called\n",
       "on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we\n",
       "cannot escape the acquaintance now.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.\n",
       "Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of joy\n",
       "was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the\n",
       "while.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should\n",
       "persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to\n",
       "neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a\n",
       "good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said a\n",
       "word about it till now.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,\" said Mr. Bennet; and,\n",
       "as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What an excellent father you have, girls!\" said she, when the door was\n",
       "shut. \"I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;\n",
       "or me, either, for that matter. At our time of life it is not so\n",
       "pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but\n",
       "for your sakes, we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_\n",
       "the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next\n",
       "ball.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh!\" said Lydia stoutly, \"I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the\n",
       "youngest, I'm the tallest.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would\n",
       "return Mr. Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to\n",
       "dinner.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Chapter 3\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five\n",
       "daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her\n",
       "husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him\n",
       "in various ways--with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and\n",
       "distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at\n",
       "last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,\n",
       "Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been\n",
       "delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely\n",
       "agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly\n",
       "with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of\n",
       "dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively\n",
       "hopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were entertained.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,\"\n",
       "said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, \"and all the others equally well\n",
       "married, I shall have nothing to wish for.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat about\n",
       "ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being\n",
       "admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had\n",
       "heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more\n",
       "fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper\n",
       "window that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.\n",
       "\n",
       "An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already\n",
       "had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her\n",
       "housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley\n",
       "was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable\n",
       "to accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite\n",
       "disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town\n",
       "so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that\n",
       "he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never\n",
       "settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears\n",
       "a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get\n",
       "a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley\n",
       "was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.\n",
       "The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the\n",
       "day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only\n",
       "six with him from London--his five sisters and a cousin. And when\n",
       "the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five\n",
       "altogether--Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and\n",
       "another young man.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant\n",
       "countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,\n",
       "with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely\n",
       "looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention\n",
       "of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and\n",
       "the report which was in general circulation within five minutes\n",
       "after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen\n",
       "pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he\n",
       "was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great\n",
       "admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust\n",
       "which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be\n",
       "proud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all\n",
       "his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most\n",
       "forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared\n",
       "with his friend.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal\n",
       "people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,\n",
       "was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving\n",
       "one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for\n",
       "themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced\n",
       "only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being\n",
       "introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in\n",
       "walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.\n",
       "His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man\n",
       "in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.\n",
       "Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of\n",
       "his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his\n",
       "having slighted one of her daughters.\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit\n",
       "down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been\n",
       "standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr.\n",
       "Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend\n",
       "to join it.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Come, Darcy,\" said he, \"I must have you dance. I hate to see you\n",
       "standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better\n",
       "dance.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am\n",
       "particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this\n",
       "it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not\n",
       "another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to\n",
       "stand up with.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I would not be so fastidious as you are,\" cried Mr. Bingley, \"for a\n",
       "kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in\n",
       "my life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see\n",
       "uncommonly pretty.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,\" said Mr.\n",
       "Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one\n",
       "of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I\n",
       "dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Which do you mean?\" and turning round he looked for a moment at\n",
       "Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said:\n",
       "\"She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; I am in no\n",
       "humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted\n",
       "by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her\n",
       "smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth\n",
       "remained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the story,\n",
       "however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,\n",

       "who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some\n",

       "things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may\n",

       "found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,\n",
       "a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards\n",
       "the two eldest. By Jane, this attention was received with the greatest\n",
       "pleasure, but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment\n",
       "of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;\n",
       "though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in\n",
       "all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration. It\n",
       "was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her and\n",
       "to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference\n",
       "which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a\n",
       "way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it\n",
       "was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane\n",
       "united, with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a\n",

       "on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be\n",
       "so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill\n",
       "from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and\n",
       "it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in\n",
       "the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every\n",
       "attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all\n",
       "_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are\n",
       "very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without\n",
       "encouragement. In nine cases out of ten a women had better show _more_\n",
       "affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he\n",
       "may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "it, he must find it out.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley and Jane\n",
       "meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they\n",
       "always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that\n",
       "every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should\n",
       "therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his\n",
       "attention. When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure for\n",

       "twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If\n",
       "the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or\n",
       "ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the\n",
       "least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to\n",
       "have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as\n",

       "was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some\n",
       "interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely\n",
       "allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the\n",
       "ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no\n",
       "sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly\n",
       "had a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered\n",
       "uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To\n",
       "this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had\n",
       "detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry\n",
       "in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and\n",
       "pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those\n",
       "of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of\n",
       "this she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made\n",
       "himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough\n",
       "to dance with.\n",
       "\n",
       "He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing\n",
       "with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so\n",
       "drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were\n",
       "assembled.\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",
       "On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have\n",
       "any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such\n",
       "a subject to him; which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she\n",
       "turned to him and said:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly\n",

       "really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of\n",
       "hearing the very best performers.\" On Miss Lucas's persevering, however,\n",
       "she added, \"Very well, if it must be so, it must.\" And gravely glancing\n",

       "sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in\n",

       "had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with\n",
       "much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the\n",
       "end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by\n",
       "Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who,\n",
       "with some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in\n",

       "\n",
       "Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of\n",
       "passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too\n",

       "\n",
       "\"What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst\n",

       "to a milliner's shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,\n",
       "Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions;\n",

       "hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news\n",
       "the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some\n",
       "from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with\n",
       "news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the\n",

       "secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr.\n",

       "\n",

       "brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as\n",

       "immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving\n",
       "alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed\n",
       "for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,\n",
       "however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them\n",
       "together, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the\n",
       "extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended\n",

       "examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught\n",
       "a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;\n",
       "advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice\n",
       "was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head\n",
       "ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor were\n",
       "the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, in\n",

       "in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer\n",
       "of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present.\n",

       "shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked\n",
       "being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their\n",

       "herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the\n",

       "\n",
       "When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley\n",

       "\"She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent\n",

       "\n",
       "\"She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very\n",
       "nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the\n",

       "\n",

       "all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably\n",
       "well when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite\n",
       "escaped my notice.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,\" said Miss Bingley; \"and I am\n",

       "\"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.\"\n",

       "\"That is capital,\" added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.\n",

       "\n",
       "To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their\n",

       "their dear friend's vulgar relations.\n",
       "\n",
       "With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room on\n",
       "leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.\n",
       "She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till\n",
       "late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep, and\n",
       "when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go\n",
       "downstairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole\n",
       "party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting\n",
       "them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the\n",
       "excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay\n",
       "below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Do you prefer reading to cards?\" said he; \"that is rather singular.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Miss Eliza Bennet,\" said Miss Bingley, \"despises cards. She is a great\n",
       "reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,\" cried Elizabeth; \"I am\n",
       "_not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,\" said Bingley; \"and\n",

       "\n",
       "Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards the\n",

       "\"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own\n",

       "than I ever looked into.\"\n",

       "\n",
       "\"It ought to be good,\" he replied, \"it has been the work of many\n",

       "\"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying\n",

       "\"I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as\n",
       "these.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of\n",
       "that noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be\n",

       "\n",
       "\"I wish it may.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that\n",

       "finer county in England than Derbyshire.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "\"I am talking of possibilities, Charles.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get\n",
       "Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her very\n",
       "little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew\n",
       "near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his\n",
       "eldest sister, to observe the game.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?\" said Miss Bingley; \"will\n",
       "she be as tall as I am?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or\n",
       "rather taller.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me\n",
       "so much. Such a countenance, such manners! And so extremely accomplished\n",
       "for her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is amazing to me,\" said Bingley, \"how young ladies can have patience\n",
       "to be so very accomplished as they all are.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and\n",
       "net purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sure\n",
       "I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being\n",
       "informed that she was very accomplished.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,\" said Darcy, \"has\n",
       "too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no\n",
       "otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen. But I am very\n",
       "far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I\n",
       "cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my\n",
       "acquaintance, that are really accomplished.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Nor I, I am sure,\" said Miss Bingley.\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! certainly,\" cried his faithful assistant, \"no one can be really\n",
       "esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met\n",
       "with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,\n",
       "dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides\n",
       "all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of\n",
       "walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word\n",
       "will be but half-deserved.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"All this she must possess,\" added Darcy, \"and to all this she must\n",

       "extensive reading.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.\n",

       "\n",
       "Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her\n",
       "implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who\n",
       "answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with\n",
       "bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all\n",
       "conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the\n",
       "room.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Elizabeth Bennet,\" said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her,\n",
       "\"is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the\n",
       "other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it\n",
       "succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Undoubtedly,\" replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,\n",
       "\"there is a meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend\n",

       "despicable.\"\n",

       "continue the subject.\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and\n",
       "that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones being sent for\n",
       "immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could\n",
       "be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most\n",
       "eminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so\n",
       "unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled\n",
       "that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet\n",
       "were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters\n",
       "declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,\n",
       "however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief\n",
       "to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every\n",

       "morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the\n",
       "inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,\n",
       "and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his\n",
       "sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a\n",
       "note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her\n",
       "own judgement of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and\n",
       "its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her\n",
       "two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.\n",
       "\n",
       "Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been\n",
       "very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was\n",

       "restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She\n",
       "would not listen, therefore, to her daughter's proposal of being carried\n",
       "home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think\n",
       "it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss\n",
       "Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all\n",
       "attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes\n",
       "that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Indeed I have, sir,\" was her answer. \"She is a great deal too ill to be\n",

       "a little longer on your kindness.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "\"You may depend upon it, Madam,\" said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,\n",

       "remains with us.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am sure,\" she added, \"if it was not for such good friends I do not\n",
       "know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers\n",
       "a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is\n",
       "always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest\n",
       "temper I have ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are\n",
       "nothing to _her_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a\n",
       "charming prospect over the gravel walk. I do not know a place in the\n",

       "in a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short lease.\"\n",

       "\"I did not know before,\" continued Bingley immediately, \"that you were a\n",
       "studier of character. It must be an amusing study.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at\n",
       "least that advantage.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The country,\" said Darcy, \"can in general supply but a few subjects for\n",
       "such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and\n",
       "unvarying society.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be\n",
       "observed in them for ever.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, indeed,\" cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning\n",
       "a country neighbourhood. \"I assure you there is quite as much of _that_\n",
       "going on in the country as in town.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,\n",
       "turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete\n",
       "victory over him, continued her triumph.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for\n",
       "my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal\n",
       "pleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"When I am in the country,\" he replied, \"I never wish to leave it;\n",
       "and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their\n",
       "advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Aye--that is because you have the right disposition. But that\n",
       "gentleman,\" looking at Darcy, \"seemed to think the country was nothing\n",
       "at all.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken,\" said Elizabeth, blushing for her\n",
       "mother. \"You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not\n",
       "such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town,\n",
       "which you must acknowledge to be true.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting\n",
       "with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few\n",
       "neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his\n",
       "countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eyes towards\n",
       "Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of\n",
       "saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if\n",
       "Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir\n",
       "William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So much the man of fashion! So\n",
       "genteel and easy! He has always something to say to everybody. _That_\n",
       "is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very\n",
       "important, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Did Charlotte dine with you?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For\n",
       "my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their own work;\n",
       "_my_ daughters are brought up very differently. But everybody is to\n",
       "judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls,\n",
       "I assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that I think\n",
       "Charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"She seems a very pleasant young woman.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself\n",
       "has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty. I do not like to boast\n",
       "of my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see anybody\n",
       "better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own\n",
       "partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother\n",
       "Gardiner's in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was\n",
       "sure he would make her an offer before we came away. But, however, he\n",
       "did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verses\n",
       "on her, and very pretty they were.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And so ended his affection,\" said Elizabeth impatiently. \"There has\n",
       "been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first\n",
       "discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,\" said Darcy.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is\n",
       "strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I\n",
       "am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth\n",
       "tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to\n",
       "speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.\n",
       "Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to\n",
       "Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was\n",
       "unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be\n",
       "civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part\n",
       "indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and\n",
       "soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of\n",
       "her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to\n",
       "each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the\n",
       "youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming\n",
       "into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.\n",
       "\n",
       "Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion\n",
       "and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose\n",
       "affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high\n",
       "animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the\n",
       "attention of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners, and her own\n",
       "easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very\n",
       "equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and\n",
       "abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most\n",
       "shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this\n",
       "sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when\n",
       "your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of\n",
       "the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Lydia declared herself satisfied. \"Oh! yes--it would be much better to\n",
       "wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter\n",
       "would be at Meryton again. And when you have given _your_ ball,\" she\n",
       "added, \"I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel\n",
       "Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned\n",
       "instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the\n",
       "remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,\n",
       "could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of\n",

       "Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching\n",
       "the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by\n",

       "Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in\n",

       "writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of\n",
       "thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you\n",
       "think at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with\n",
       "quickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without any\n",
       "attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.\n",
       "Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield\n",
       "you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of\n",
       "panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very\n",

       "\n",

       "I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this\n",

       "dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were\n",
       "mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had better\n",
       "stay till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not\n",

       "more than he did himself.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am exceedingly gratified,\" said Bingley, \"by your converting what my\n",

       "afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means\n",
       "intend; for he would certainly think better of me, if under such a\n",
       "circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I\n",

       "but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to\n",
       "stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet,\n",
       "that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and\n",
       "the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering\n",
       "one argument in favour of its propriety.\"\n",

       "either.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make\n",
       "one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason\n",
       "one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have\n",
       "supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the\n",
       "circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour\n",
       "thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,\n",
       "where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no\n",

       "between the parties?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"By all means,\" cried Bingley; \"let us hear all the particulars, not\n",
       "forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more\n",
       "weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure\n",
       "you, that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with\n",
       "myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not\n",
       "know a more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in\n",
       "particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,\n",
       "when he has nothing to do.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was\n",
       "rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly\n",
       "resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her\n",
       "brother for talking such nonsense.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I see your design, Bingley,\" said his friend. \"You dislike an argument,\n",
       "and want to silence this.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss\n",
       "Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very\n",
       "thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth\n",
       "for an indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with some alacrity\n",
       "to the pianoforte; and, after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead\n",
       "the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she\n",
       "seated herself.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed,\n",
       "Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books\n",
       "that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixed\n",
       "on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of\n",
       "admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her\n",
       "because he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine,\n",
       "however, at last that she drew his notice because there was something\n",
       "more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in\n",
       "any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked\n",

       "to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from\n",

       "directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that\n",
       "he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down\n",
       "the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would\n",
       "interfere. \"What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his\n",
       "meaning?\"--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not at all,\" was her answer; \"but depend upon it, he means to be severe\n",

       "about it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in\n",

       "\n",
       "\"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,\" said he, as soon\n",

       "the evening because you are in each other's confidence, and have secret\n",
       "affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures\n",
       "appear to the greatest advantage in walking; if the first, I would be\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,\" said Elizabeth. \"We\n",

       "Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_ divert me, I own,\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study\n",

       "\n",
       "\"No,\" said Darcy, \"I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,\n",
       "but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch\n",
       "for. It is, I believe, too little yielding--certainly too little for the\n",
       "convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of others\n",
       "so soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself. My feelings\n",
       "are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper\n",

       "forever.\"\n",

       "of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been\n",
       "suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight\n",
       "in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke\n",
       "ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were\n",

       "people he knew, but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her.\n",
       "She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she\n",
       "made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the\n",
       "neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or\n",

       "marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had\n",
       "once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly\n",

       "to suggest some herself--some shelves in the closet up stairs.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"and\n",

       "\n",
       "\"She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself says\n",

       "handsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features which marks\n",
       "the young lady of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly\n",
       "constitution, which has prevented her from making that progress in many\n",
       "accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I am\n",
       "informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still\n",
       "resides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends\n",

       "and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has deprived the\n",
       "British court of its brightest ornament. Her ladyship seemed pleased\n",
       "with the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to\n",
       "offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable\n",
       "to ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that\n",
       "her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most\n",
       "elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by\n",
       "her. These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and\n",
       "it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to\n",
       "pay.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You judge very properly,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"and it is happy for you\n",
       "that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask\n",
       "whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the\n",
       "moment, or are the result of previous study?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I\n",
       "sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant\n",

       "give them as unstudied an air as possible.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Bennet's expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd\n",
       "as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,\n",
       "maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,\n",
       "and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner\n",
       "in his pleasure.\n",
       "\n",
       "By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad\n",
       "to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and, when tea was over,\n",
       "glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily\n",
       "assented, and a book was produced; but, on beholding it (for everything\n",
       "announced it to be from a circulating library), he started back, and\n",
       "begging pardon, protested that he never read novels. Kitty stared at\n",
       "him, and Lydia exclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some\n",
       "deliberation he chose Fordyce's Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened the\n",
       "volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three\n",
       "pages, she interrupted him with:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away\n",

       "\"I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books\n",
       "of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes\n",

       "miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he\n",

       "good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in\n",
       "retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected\n",
       "prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de\n",

       "pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately\n",
       "had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had\n",
       "reached the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated\n",

       "him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a\n",
       "commission in their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the\n",
       "young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming.\n",
       "His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of\n",
       "beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.\n",
       "The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness\n",
       "of conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and\n",
       "unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together\n",
       "very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy\n",
       "and Bingley were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the\n",
       "ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and\n",
       "began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and\n",
       "Miss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to\n",
       "Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated\n",
       "it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes\n",
       "on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the\n",
       "stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they\n",
       "looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.\n",
       "Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham,\n",
       "after a few moments, touched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just\n",

       "imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",

       "capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself, for\n",

       "\"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after\n",
       "seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting\n",
       "yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"As much as I ever wish to be,\" cried Elizabeth very warmly. \"I have\n",
       "spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very\n",
       "disagreeable.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have no right to give _my_ opinion,\" said Wickham, \"as to his being\n",
       "agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him\n",
       "too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_\n",
       "to be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general\n",
       "astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly\n",
       "anywhere else. Here you are in your own family.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Upon my word, I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in\n",
       "the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in\n",
       "Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find\n",
       "him more favourably spoken of by anyone.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I cannot pretend to be sorry,\" said Wickham, after a short\n",
       "interruption, \"that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond\n",
       "their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The\n",
       "world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his\n",
       "high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an\n",
       "ill-tempered man.\" Wickham only shook his head.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I wonder,\" said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, \"whether he is\n",
       "likely to be in this country much longer.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I\n",
       "was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will\n",
       "not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_\n",
       "wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go. We are not on friendly terms,\n",
       "and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for\n",
       "avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim before all the world, a sense\n",
       "of very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he\n",
       "is. His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men\n",
       "that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never\n",
       "be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by\n",
       "a thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been\n",
       "scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and\n",
       "everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the\n",
       "memory of his father.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with\n",
       "all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the\n",
       "neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that\n",
       "he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but very\n",
       "intelligible gallantry.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,\" he added,\n",
       "\"which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I knew it to be\n",
       "a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me\n",
       "further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great\n",
       "attentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them.\n",
       "Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and\n",
       "my spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society.\n",
       "A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have\n",
       "now made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I\n",
       "was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in\n",
       "possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we\n",
       "were speaking of just now.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Indeed!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best\n",
       "living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.\n",
       "I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,\n",
       "and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given\n",
       "elsewhere.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Good heavens!\" cried Elizabeth; \"but how could _that_ be? How could his\n",
       "will be disregarded? Why did you not seek legal redress?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to\n",
       "give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the\n",
       "intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely\n",
       "conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim\n",
       "to it by extravagance, imprudence--in short anything or nothing. Certain\n",
       "it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was\n",
       "of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no\n",
       "less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done\n",
       "anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and\n",
       "I may have spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too freely. I can\n",
       "recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sort\n",
       "of men, and that he hates me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till I\n",
       "can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than\n",
       "ever as he expressed them.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But what,\" said she, after a pause, \"can have been his motive? What can\n",
       "have induced him to behave so cruelly?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but\n",
       "attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me\n",
       "less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon\n",
       "attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had\n",
       "not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort\n",
       "of preference which was often given me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked\n",
       "him. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had supposed him to be\n",
       "despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of\n",
       "descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as\n",
       "this.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "After a few minutes' reflection, however, she continued, \"I _do_\n",
       "remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of\n",
       "his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition\n",
       "must be dreadful.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I will not trust myself on the subject,\" replied Wickham; \"I can hardly\n",
       "be just to him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, \"To\n",
       "treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his\n",
       "father!\" She could have added, \"A young man, too, like _you_, whose very\n",
       "countenance may vouch for your being amiable\"--but she contented herself\n",
       "with, \"and one, too, who had probably been his companion from childhood,\n",
       "connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest\n",
       "part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,\n",
       "sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_\n",
       "father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Phillips,\n",
       "appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up everything to be of\n",
       "use to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the\n",
       "Pemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most\n",
       "intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to\n",
       "be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendence,\n",
       "and when, immediately before my father's death, Mr. Darcy gave him a\n",
       "voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to\n",
       "be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of his affection to myself.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How strange!\" cried Elizabeth. \"How abominable! I wonder that the very\n",
       "pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! If from no better\n",
       "motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest--for\n",
       "dishonesty I must call it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It _is_ wonderful,\" replied Wickham, \"for almost all his actions may\n",
       "be traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend. It has\n",
       "connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling. But we are\n",
       "none of us consistent, and in his behaviour to me there were stronger\n",
       "impulses even than pride.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his money\n",
       "freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the\n",
       "poor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride--for he is very proud of what\n",
       "his father was--have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family,\n",
       "to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the\n",
       "Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,\n",
       "which, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and\n",
       "careful guardian of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried up\n",
       "as the most attentive and best of brothers.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He shook his head. \"I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to\n",
       "speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brother--very, very\n",
       "proud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond\n",
       "of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is\n",
       "nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,\n",
       "and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father's death, her\n",
       "home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her\n",
       "education.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not\n",
       "help reverting once more to the first, and saying:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley,\n",
       "who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,\n",
       "be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you\n",
       "know Mr. Bingley?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not at all.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr.\n",
       "Darcy is.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not\n",
       "want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth\n",
       "his while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is\n",
       "a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His\n",
       "pride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,\n",
       "sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable--allowing something\n",
       "for fortune and figure.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round\n",
       "the other table and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin\n",
       "Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips. The usual inquiries as to his success were\n",
       "made by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every\n",
       "point; but when Mrs. Phillips began to express her concern thereupon,\n",
       "he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least\n",
       "importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged\n",

       "not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked\n",
       "her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the\n",
       "reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe\n",
       "she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from\n",
       "her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for her\n",

       "they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,\n",
       "apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being\n",
       "aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable\n",

       "\n",
       "She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of\n",
       "Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances\n",

       "\"I dare say you will find him very agreeable.\"\n",

       "first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would\n",
       "be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made\n",
       "some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again\n",
       "silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time\n",
       "with:--\"It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. I talked\n",
       "about the dance, and _you_ ought to make some sort of remark on the size\n",
       "of the room, or the number of couples.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by I may\n",

       "\"Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be\n",
       "entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the advantage of\n",
       "_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged, as that they may have the\n",
       "trouble of saying as little as possible.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you\n",
       "imagine that you are gratifying mine?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Both,\" replied Elizabeth archly; \"for I have always seen a great\n",
       "similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,\n",
       "taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say\n",
       "something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to\n",
       "posterity with all the eclat of a proverb.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,\"\n",
       "said he. \"How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say. _You_\n",
       "think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I must not decide on my own performance.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down\n",
       "the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often\n",
       "walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist\n",
       "the temptation, added, \"When you met us there the other day, we had just\n",
       "been forming a new acquaintance.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his\n",
       "features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself\n",
       "for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a\n",
       "constrained manner said, \"Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners\n",
       "as may ensure his _making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of\n",
       "_retaining_ them, is less certain.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At\n",
       "that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass\n",
       "through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr.\n",
       "Darcy, he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on\n",
       "his dancing and his partner.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very\n",
       "superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the\n",
       "first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not\n",
       "disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,\n",
       "especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing at\n",
       "her sister and Bingley) shall take place. What congratulations will then\n",
       "flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you, sir. You\n",
       "will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that\n",

       "\n",
       "The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir\n",

       "eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and\n",
       "Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,\n",
       "he turned to his partner, and said, \"Sir William's interruption has made\n",
       "me forget what we were talking of.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have\n",
       "interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.\n",
       "We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we\n",
       "are to talk of next I cannot imagine.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What think you of books?\" said he, smiling.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Books--oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same\n",
       "feelings.\"\n",

       "with a look of doubt.\n",

       "\"Yes, always,\" she replied, without knowing what she said, for her\n",

       "by her suddenly exclaiming, \"I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,\n",
       "that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was\n",
       "unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being\n",

       "to be secure of judging properly at first.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"May I ask to what these questions tend?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,\" said she, endeavouring\n",
       "to shake off her gravity. \"I am trying to make it out.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And what is your success?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She shook her head. \"I do not get on at all. I hear such different\n",

       "\n",
       "\"I can readily believe,\" answered he gravely, \"that reports may vary\n",
       "greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were\n",
       "not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to\n",
       "fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "\"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,\" he coldly replied.\n",
       "She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in\n",
       "silence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree,\n",
       "for in Darcy's breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards\n",
       "her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against\n",
       "another.\n",
       "\n",
       "They had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her, and\n",
       "with an expression of civil disdain accosted her:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham!\n",
       "Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand\n",
       "questions; and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell you, among\n",
       "his other communication, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late\n",
       "Mr. Darcy's steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to\n",
       "give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy's\n",
       "using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has\n",
       "always been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated\n",
       "Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but\n",
       "I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he\n",
       "cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother\n",
       "thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to\n",
       "the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself\n",
       "out of the way. His coming into the country at all is a most insolent\n",
       "thing, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you,\n",
       "Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt; but really,\n",
       "considering his descent, one could not expect much better.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,\" said\n",
       "Elizabeth angrily; \"for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse\n",
       "than of being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I can\n",
       "assure you, he informed me himself.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I beg your pardon,\" replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.\n",
       "\"Excuse my interference--it was kindly meant.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Insolent girl!\" said Elizabeth to herself. \"You are much mistaken\n",
       "if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see\n",
       "nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.\n",
       "Darcy.\" She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make\n",
       "inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of\n",
       "such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently\n",
       "marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.\n",
       "Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for\n",
       "Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way\n",
       "before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I want to know,\" said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her\n",
       "sister's, \"what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have\n",
       "been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case\n",
       "you may be sure of my pardon.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No,\" replied Jane, \"I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing\n",
       "satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of\n",
       "his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have\n",
       "principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,\n",
       "the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that\n",
       "Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has\n",
       "received; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister's,\n",
       "Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has\n",
       "been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy's regard.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am\n",
       "satisfied. But what does he say of the living?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard\n",
       "them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to\n",
       "him _conditionally_ only.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley's sincerity,\" said Elizabeth warmly;\n",
       "\"but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.\n",
       "Bingley's defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but\n",
       "since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt\n",
       "the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think of\n",
       "both gentlemen as I did before.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on\n",
       "which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with\n",
       "delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr.\n",
       "Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence\n",
       "in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew\n",
       "to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last\n",
       "partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,\n",
       "and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as\n",
       "to make a most important discovery.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have found out,\" said he, \"by a singular accident, that there is now\n",
       "in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the\n",
       "gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of\n",
       "the house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady\n",
       "Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have\n",
       "thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de\n",
       "Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made\n",
       "in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to\n",
       "do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total\n",
       "ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.\n",
       "I believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_. It will be in my power to\n",
       "assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'nnight.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring him\n",
       "that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction\n",
       "as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that\n",
       "it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either\n",
       "side; and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in\n",
       "consequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her\n",
       "with the determined air of following his own inclination, and, when she\n",
       "ceased speaking, replied thus:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world in\n",
       "your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your\n",
       "understanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a wide\n",
       "difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity,\n",
       "and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that\n",
       "I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with\n",
       "the highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of\n",
       "behaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore allow me to\n",
       "follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to\n",
       "perform what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to\n",
       "profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant\n",
       "guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by\n",
       "education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young\n",
       "lady like yourself.\" And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr.\n",
       "Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose\n",
       "astonishment at being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced\n",
       "his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of\n",
       "it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the\n",
       "words \"apology,\" \"Hunsford,\" and \"Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\" It vexed\n",
       "her to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him\n",
       "with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time\n",
       "to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however,\n",
       "was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed\n",
       "abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the\n",
       "end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr.\n",
       "Collins then returned to Elizabeth.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have no reason, I assure you,\" said he, \"to be dissatisfied with my\n",
       "reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered\n",
       "me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying\n",
       "that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be\n",
       "certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very\n",
       "handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned\n",
       "her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the\n",
       "train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,\n",
       "made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in\n",
       "that very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection\n",
       "could bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of\n",
       "endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters. Her mother's thoughts\n",
       "she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to\n",
       "venture near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to\n",
       "supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which\n",
       "placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find\n",
       "that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,\n",
       "openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane would soon\n",
       "be married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet\n",
       "seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the\n",
       "match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but\n",
       "three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and\n",
       "then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of\n",
       "Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as\n",
       "she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger\n",
       "daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of\n",
       "other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be\n",
       "able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that\n",
       "she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was\n",
       "necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on\n",
       "such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.\n",
       "Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. She\n",
       "concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally\n",
       "fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no\n",
       "chance of it.\n",
       "\n",
       "In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's\n",
       "words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible\n",
       "whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the\n",
       "chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her\n",
       "mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am\n",
       "sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say\n",
       "nothing _he_ may not like to hear.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be for you\n",
       "to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by\n",
       "so doing!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would\n",
       "talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and\n",
       "blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently\n",
       "glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what\n",
       "she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was\n",
       "convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression\n",
       "of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and\n",
       "steady gravity.\n",
       "\n",
       "At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who\n",
       "had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no\n",
       "likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and\n",
       "chicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of\n",
       "tranquillity; for, when supper was over, singing was talked of, and\n",
       "she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,\n",
       "preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent\n",
       "entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,\n",
       "but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of\n",
       "exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth's\n",
       "eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched her\n",
       "progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very\n",
       "ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving, amongst the thanks\n",
       "of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to\n",
       "favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another.\n",
       "Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was\n",
       "weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at\n",
       "Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to\n",
       "Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs\n",
       "of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,\n",
       "imperturbably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his\n",
       "interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,\n",
       "and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud, \"That will do\n",
       "extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let the other\n",
       "young ladies have time to exhibit.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and\n",
       "Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid\n",
       "her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"If I,\" said Mr. Collins, \"were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I\n",
       "should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an\n",
       "air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly\n",
       "compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however,\n",
       "to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time\n",
       "to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The\n",
       "rector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make\n",
       "such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not\n",
       "offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time\n",
       "that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care\n",
       "and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making\n",
       "as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance\n",
       "that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody,\n",
       "especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit\n",
       "him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an\n",
       "occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the\n",
       "family.\" And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had\n",
       "been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room. Many stared--many\n",
       "smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his\n",
       "wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly,\n",
       "and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably\n",
       "clever, good kind of young man.\n",
       "\n",
       "To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement to\n",
       "expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would\n",
       "have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or\n",
       "finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister\n",
       "that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his\n",
       "feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he\n",
       "must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should\n",
       "have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough,\n",
       "and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the\n",
       "gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.\n",
       "\n",
       "The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by\n",
       "Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though\n",
       "he could not prevail on her to dance with him again, put it out of her\n",
       "power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with\n",
       "somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.\n",
       "He assured her, that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;\n",
       "that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to\n",
       "her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her\n",
       "the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed\n",
       "her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and\n",
       "good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to herself.\n",
       "\n",
       "She was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy's further notice;\n",
       "though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite\n",
       "disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the\n",
       "probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in\n",
       "it.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart, and, by\n",
       "a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriage a quarter of\n",
       "an hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how\n",
       "heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her\n",
       "sister scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and\n",
       "were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed\n",
       "every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a\n",
       "languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the\n",
       "long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his\n",

       "of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will\n",

       "to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and\n",
       "recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling\n",

       "arranging Miss de Bourgh's footstool, that she said, 'Mr. Collins, you\n",
       "must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose\n",
       "a gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,\n",
       "useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small\n",
       "income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as\n",
       "you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow me, by the\n",
       "way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice\n",
       "and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the\n",
       "advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond\n",
       "anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be\n",
       "acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and\n",
       "respect which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general\n",
       "intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views\n",
       "were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I\n",
       "can assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that\n",
       "being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured\n",
       "father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy\n",
       "myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that\n",
       "the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy\n",
       "event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not\n",
       "be for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and\n",
       "I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing\n",
       "remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the\n",
       "violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and\n",
       "shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well\n",
       "aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds\n",
       "in the four per cents, which will not be yours till after your mother's\n",
       "decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,\n",
       "therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that\n",
       "no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.\n",
       "\n",

       "the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of\n",

       "decline them.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am not now to learn,\" replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the\n",

       "man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their\n",
       "favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a\n",
       "third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just\n",
       "said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Upon my word, sir,\" cried Elizabeth, \"your hope is a rather\n",
       "extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not\n",
       "one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so\n",
       "daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second\n",
       "time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make _me_\n",
       "happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who\n",
       "could make you so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I\n",
       "am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the\n",
       "situation.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,\" said Mr. Collins\n",
       "very gravely--\"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all\n",
       "disapprove of you. And you may be certain when I have the honour of\n",
       "seeing her again, I shall speak in the very highest terms of your\n",
       "modesty, economy, and other amiable qualification.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You\n",
       "must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment\n",
       "of believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by\n",
       "refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.\n",
       "In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your\n",
       "feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn\n",
       "estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may\n",
       "be considered, therefore, as finally settled.\" And rising as she\n",
       "thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not thus\n",
       "addressed her:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I\n",
       "shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given\n",
       "me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I\n",
       "know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on\n",
       "the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to\n",
       "encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the\n",
       "female character.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Really, Mr. Collins,\" cried Elizabeth with some warmth, \"you puzzle me\n",
       "exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form\n",
       "of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as\n",
       "to convince you of its being one.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your\n",
       "refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for\n",
       "believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand is\n",
       "unworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would\n",
       "be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections\n",
       "with the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are\n",
       "circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further\n",
       "consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no\n",
       "means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your\n",
       "portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo\n",
       "the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must\n",
       "therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me,\n",
       "I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by\n",
       "suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind\n",
       "of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would\n",
       "rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you\n",
       "again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but\n",
       "to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect\n",
       "forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant\n",
       "female, intending to plague you, but as a rational creature, speaking\n",
       "the truth from her heart.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are uniformly charming!\" cried he, with an air of awkward\n",
       "gallantry; \"and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express\n",

       "being acceptable.\"\n",

       "To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make\n",
       "no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if\n",
       "he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering\n",
       "encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered\n",
       "in such a manner as to be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could\n",

       "is not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.\n",
       "Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the\n",
       "case is this: We are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she\n",
       "is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion\n",
       "that when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble\n",
       "in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and\n",
       "I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But,\n",
       "my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley\n",
       "tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest\n",
       "degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on\n",
       "Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead\n",

       "\n",
       "\"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,\" replied Jane, \"your\n",
       "representation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the\n",
       "foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving\n",
       "anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that she is deceiving\n",
       "herself.\"\n",

       "\n",

       "deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is\n",
       "more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by\n",
       "all means to refuse him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How can you talk so?\" said Jane, faintly smiling. \"You must know that\n",

       "They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the\n",

       "but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,\n",
       "and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen\n",
       "to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After\n",
       "lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation that Mr.\n",
       "Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the\n",
       "conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration, that though he had\n",

       "favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost\n",
       "secure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very\n",
       "soon. But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his\n",
       "character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next\n",
       "morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw\n",
       "himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,\n",
       "from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to\n",
       "conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known\n",
       "till its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost\n",
       "secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,\n",
       "he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.\n",
       "His reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas\n",
       "perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and\n",

       "was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must\n",
       "be waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with\n",

       "circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom\n",
       "they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were\n",
       "exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more\n",
       "interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer\n",
       "Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided\n",

       "Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife\n",
       "should make their appearance at St. James's. The whole family, in short,\n",
       "were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes\n",
       "of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have\n",
       "done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's\n",
       "dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had\n",
       "gained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were\n",
       "in general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible\n",
       "nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must\n",
       "be imaginary. But still he would be her husband. Without thinking highly\n",
       "either of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was\n",
       "the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune,\n",
       "and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest\n",
       "preservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at\n",

       "shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved\n",
       "to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins,\n",
       "when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had\n",
       "passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very\n",
       "dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the\n",
       "curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct\n",
       "questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was\n",
       "at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to\n",

       "offending your patroness.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My dear sir,\" replied Mr. Collins, \"I am particularly obliged to you\n",
       "for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so\n",
       "material a step without her ladyship's concurrence.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather than her\n",
       "displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us\n",
       "again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,\n",
       "and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such\n",
       "affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive\n",
       "from me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other mark of your\n",
       "regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, though\n",
       "my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now\n",
       "take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my\n",
       "cousin Elizabeth.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally\n",
       "surprised that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished to\n",
       "understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her\n",
       "younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.\n",
       "She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was\n",
       "a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no\n",
       "means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read\n",
       "and improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very\n",
       "agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this\n",
       "kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a\n",
       "private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.\n",
       "\n",
       "The possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying himself in love with her\n",
       "friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but\n",
       "that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from\n",
       "possibility as she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was\n",
       "consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and\n",
       "she could not help crying out:\n",
       "\n",

       "reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained\n",
       "her composure, and calmly replied:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible\n",
       "that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion,\n",
       "because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort\n",
       "for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of\n",
       "their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her\n",
       "all imaginable happiness.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I see what you are feeling,\" replied Charlotte. \"You must be surprised,\n",
       "very much surprised--so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry\n",
       "you. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be\n",
       "satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never\n",
       "was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins's\n",
       "character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my\n",

       "entering the marriage state.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth quietly answered \"Undoubtedly;\" and after an awkward pause,\n",
       "they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much\n",
       "longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.\n",
       "It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so\n",
       "unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making two offers\n",
       "of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now\n",
       "accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was\n",
       "not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible\n",
       "that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better\n",
       "feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a\n",
       "most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself\n",
       "and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it\n",
       "was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had\n",

       "offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance; and I\n",

       "town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go\n",
       "out so little, that it is very improbable that they should meet at all,\n",

       "\n",

       "a part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may\n",
       "perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he\n",
       "would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its\n",
       "impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley\n",
       "never stirs without him.\"\n",

       "hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that\n",

       "of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family\n",
       "dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always\n",

       "of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and\n",

       "part of Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many\n",
       "acquaintances in common; and though Wickham had been little there since\n",

       "\n",
       "Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by\n",

       "description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of\n",
       "praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both\n",
       "him and herself. On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy's\n",
       "treatment of him, she tried to remember some of that gentleman's\n",
       "reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it, and\n",

       "Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to\n",

       "blind to Miss Bingley's inattention. After waiting at home every morning\n",
       "for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the\n",
       "visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,\n",
       "the alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no\n",
       "longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will\n",
       "prove what she felt.\n",

       "wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were to\n",
       "happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not\n",
       "return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I\n",
       "receive in the meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that\n",
       "she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not\n",
       "calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was\n",
       "in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was\n",
       "perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity,\n",
       "though I cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out\n",
       "as she did; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on\n",
       "her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting\n",
       "wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the\n",
       "cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and though _we_ know\n",
       "this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily\n",
       "account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to\n",
       "his sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and\n",

       "cannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should\n",
       "be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity\n",
       "in all this. But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought,\n",
       "and think only of what will make me happy--your affection, and the\n",
       "invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very\n",

       "wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen\n",

       "prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered\n",
       "the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome\n",
       "modern building, well situated on rising ground.\n",
       "\n",
       "From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows;\n",
       "but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white\n",
       "frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte\n",
       "took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,\n",
       "probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband's\n",
       "help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything\n",
       "was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which\n",
       "Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be\n",
       "forgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by\n",
       "Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often\n",
       "forgotten.\n",
       "\n",
       "She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It\n",
       "was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining\n",
       "in, observed:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine\n",
       "de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will\n",
       "be delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I\n",
       "doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice\n",
       "when service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she\n",
       "will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she\n",
       "honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is\n",
       "charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed\n",
       "to walk home. Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us. I\n",
       "_should_ say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,\" added\n",
       "Charlotte, \"and a most attentive neighbour.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of\n",
       "woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news,\n",
       "and telling again what had already been written; and when it closed,\n",
       "Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon\n",
       "Charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,\n",
       "and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it\n",
       "was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit\n",
       "would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious\n",
       "interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with\n",
       "Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.\n",
       "\n",
       "About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready\n",
       "for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in\n",
       "confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running\n",
       "up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened\n",
       "the door and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with\n",
       "agitation, cried out--\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for\n",
       "there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make\n",
       "haste, and come down this moment.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more,\n",
       "and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in\n",
       "quest of this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the\n",
       "garden gate.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And is this all?\" cried Elizabeth. \"I expected at least that the pigs\n",
       "were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her\n",
       "daughter.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"La! my dear,\" said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, \"it is not\n",
       "Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them;\n",
       "the other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little\n",
       "creature. Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.\n",
       "Why does she not come in?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours\n",
       "when Miss de Bourgh comes in.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I like her appearance,\" said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. \"She\n",
       "looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will\n",
       "make him a very proper wife.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation\n",
       "with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high diversion, was\n",
       "stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness\n",
       "before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that\n",
       "way.\n",
       "\n",
       "At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and\n",
       "the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two\n",
       "girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which\n",
       "Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked\n",
       "to dine at Rosings the next day.\n",

       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Collins's triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.\n",
       "The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering\n",
       "visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his\n",
       "wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity\n",
       "of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady\n",
       "Catherine's condescension, as he knew not how to admire enough.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I confess,\" said he, \"that I should not have been at all surprised by\n",
       "her ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at\n",
       "Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it\n",
       "would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who\n",
       "could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there\n",
       "(an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately\n",
       "after your arrival!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am the less surprised at what has happened,\" replied Sir William,\n",
       "\"from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which\n",
       "my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such\n",
       "instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their\n",
       "visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what\n",
       "they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and\n",
       "so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.\n",
       "\n",
       "When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth--\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady\n",
       "Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which\n",
       "becomes herself and her daughter. I would advise you merely to put on\n",
       "whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion\n",
       "for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you\n",
       "for being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank\n",
       "preserved.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different\n",
       "doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much\n",
       "objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of\n",
       "her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas\n",
       "who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her\n",
       "introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done\n",
       "to his presentation at St. James's.\n",
       "\n",
       "As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a\n",
       "mile across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and\n",
       "Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such\n",
       "raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but\n",
       "slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the\n",
       "house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally\n",
       "cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.\n",
       "\n",
       "When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every\n",
       "moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.\n",
       "Elizabeth's courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady\n",
       "Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or\n",
       "miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought\n",
       "she could witness without trepidation.\n",
       "\n",
       "From the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a\n",
       "rapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments, they\n",
       "followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room where Lady\n",
       "Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her ladyship,\n",
       "with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had\n",
       "settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should\n",
       "be hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those\n",
       "apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.\n",
       "\n",
       "In spite of having been at St. James's, Sir William was so completely\n",
       "awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage\n",
       "enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;\n",
       "and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge\n",
       "of her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself\n",
       "quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her\n",
       "composedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked\n",
       "features, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not\n",
       "conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her\n",
       "visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by\n",
       "silence; but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone,\n",
       "as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to\n",
       "Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she\n",
       "believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he represented.\n",
       "\n",
       "When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment\n",
       "she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the\n",
       "daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment at her\n",
       "being so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any\n",
       "likeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her\n",
       "features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very\n",
       "little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance\n",
       "there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening\n",
       "to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before\n",
       "her eyes.\n",
       "\n",
       "After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to\n",
       "admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties,\n",
       "and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth\n",
       "looking at in the summer.\n",
       "\n",
       "The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants and\n",
       "all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had\n",
       "likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her\n",
       "ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish\n",
       "nothing greater. He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted\n",
       "alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir\n",
       "William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law\n",
       "said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.\n",
       "But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and\n",
       "gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved\n",
       "a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth\n",
       "was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated\n",
       "between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in\n",
       "listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all\n",
       "dinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little\n",
       "Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing\n",
       "she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the\n",
       "gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.\n",
       "\n",
       "When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to\n",
       "be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any\n",
       "intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every\n",
       "subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not used to\n",
       "have her judgement controverted. She inquired into Charlotte's domestic\n",
       "concerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a great deal of advice as\n",
       "to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be\n",
       "regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the\n",
       "care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was\n",
       "beneath this great lady's attention, which could furnish her with an\n",
       "occasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse\n",
       "with Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and\n",
       "Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew\n",
       "the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very genteel,\n",
       "pretty kind of girl. She asked her, at different times, how many sisters\n",
       "she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of\n",
       "them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they\n",
       "had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been\n",
       "her mother's maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of\n",
       "her questions but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then\n",
       "observed,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Your father's estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your\n",
       "sake,\" turning to Charlotte, \"I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no\n",
       "occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought\n",
       "necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family. Do you play and sing, Miss\n",
       "Bennet?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"A little.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our\n",
       "instrument is a capital one, probably superior to----You shall try it\n",
       "some day. Do your sisters play and sing?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"One of them does.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss\n",
       "Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do\n",
       "you draw?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, not at all.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What, none of you?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not one.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother\n",
       "should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Has your governess left you?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"We never had any governess.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home\n",
       "without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must\n",
       "have been quite a slave to your education.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been\n",
       "the case.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you\n",
       "must have been neglected.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as\n",
       "wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to\n",
       "read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be\n",
       "idle, certainly might.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had\n",
       "known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage\n",
       "one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady\n",
       "and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is\n",
       "wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that\n",
       "way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces\n",
       "of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and\n",
       "it was but the other day that I recommended another young person,\n",
       "who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite\n",
       "delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalf's\n",
       "calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. 'Lady\n",
       "Catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure.' Are any of your\n",
       "younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, ma'am, all.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The\n",
       "younger ones out before the elder ones are married! Your younger sisters\n",
       "must be very young?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to be\n",
       "much in company. But really, ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon\n",
       "younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and\n",
       "amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to\n",
       "marry early. The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth\n",
       "as the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive! I think it would\n",
       "not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Upon my word,\" said her ladyship, \"you give your opinion very decidedly\n",
       "for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"With three younger sisters grown up,\" replied Elizabeth, smiling, \"your\n",
       "ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;\n",
       "and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever\n",
       "dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need not\n",
       "conceal your age.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am not one-and-twenty.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card-tables\n",
       "were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat\n",
       "down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the\n",
       "two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her\n",
       "party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was\n",
       "uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson\n",
       "expressed her fears of Miss de Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or\n",
       "having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the\n",
       "other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes\n",
       "of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins\n",
       "was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her\n",
       "for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.\n",
       "Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes\n",
       "and noble names.\n",
       "\n",
       "When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,\n",
       "the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,\n",
       "gratefully accepted and immediately ordered. The party then gathered\n",
       "round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were\n",
       "to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by\n",
       "the arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.\n",
       "Collins's side and as many bows on Sir William's they departed. As soon\n",
       "as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin\n",
       "to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for\n",
       "Charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But her\n",
       "commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy\n",
       "Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship's praise\n",
       "into his own hands.\n",

       "Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was long\n",
       "enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled,\n",
       "and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not\n",
       "often met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his\n",
       "morning to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country; but\n",
       "when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments,\n",
       "and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her\n",
       "cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast\n",
       "and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in\n",
       "reading and writing, and looking out of the window in his own book-room,\n",
       "which fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.\n",
       "Elizabeth had at first rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer\n",
       "the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a\n",
       "more pleasant aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent\n",
       "reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been\n",
       "much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and\n",
       "she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.\n",
       "\n",
       "From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and\n",
       "were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went\n",
       "along, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,\n",
       "which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened\n",
       "almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and\n",
       "had a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever\n",
       "prevailed upon to get out.\n",
       "\n",
       "Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and\n",
       "not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;\n",
       "and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings\n",
       "to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many\n",
       "hours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship,\n",
       "and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during\n",
       "these visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work,\n",
       "and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement\n",
       "of the furniture; or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she\n",
       "accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding\n",
       "out that Mrs. Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in\n",
       "commission of the peace of the county, she was a most active magistrate\n",
       "in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her\n",
       "by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to\n",
       "be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the\n",
       "village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold\n",
       "them into harmony and plenty.\n",
       "\n",
       "The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;\n",
       "and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one\n",
       "card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart\n",
       "of the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living\n",
       "in the neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr. Collins's reach. This,\n",
       "however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time\n",
       "comfortably enough; there were half-hours of pleasant conversation with\n",
       "Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had\n",
       "often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she\n",
       "frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was\n",
       "along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was\n",
       "a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and\n",
       "where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity.\n",
       "\n",
       "In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.\n",
       "Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an\n",
       "addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be\n",
       "important. Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that Mr. Darcy was\n",
       "expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not\n",
       "many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer, his coming would\n",
       "furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and\n",
       "she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him\n",
       "were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently\n",
       "destined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest\n",
       "satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and\n",
       "seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by\n",
       "Miss Lucas and herself.\n",
       "\n",
       "His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking\n",
       "the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,\n",
       "in order to have the earliest assurance of it, and after making his\n",
       "bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great\n",
       "intelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his\n",
       "respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for\n",
       "Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of\n",
       "his uncle Lord ----, and, to the great surprise of all the party, when\n",
       "Mr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen\n",
       "them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running\n",
       "into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would\n",
       "never have come so soon to wait upon me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,\n",
       "before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly\n",
       "afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,\n",
       "who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and\n",
       "address most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been\n",
       "used to look in Hertfordshire--paid his compliments, with his usual\n",
       "reserve, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her\n",
       "friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely\n",
       "curtseyed to him without saying a word.\n",
       "\n",
       "Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the\n",
       "readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but\n",
       "his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and\n",
       "garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody.\n",
       "At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of\n",
       "Elizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual\n",
       "way, and after a moment's pause, added:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never\n",
       "happened to see her there?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see\n",
       "whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between\n",
       "the Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little confused as he\n",
       "answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The\n",
       "subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went\n",
       "away.\n",

       "Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the Parsonage,\n",
       "and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures\n",
       "of their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they\n",
       "received any invitation thither--for while there were visitors in the\n",
       "house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,\n",
       "almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by\n",
       "such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to\n",
       "come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little\n",
       "of Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the\n",
       "Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had seen\n",
       "only at church.\n",
       "\n",
       "The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined\n",
       "the party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room. Her ladyship received\n",
       "them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so\n",
       "acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,\n",
       "almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,\n",
       "much more than to any other person in the room.\n",
       "\n",
       "Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was a\n",
       "welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins's pretty friend had\n",
       "moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and\n",
       "talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying\n",
       "at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so\n",
       "well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much\n",
       "spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself,\n",
       "as well as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned\n",
       "towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship, after a\n",
       "while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not\n",
       "scruple to call out:\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I\n",
       "must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music.\n",
       "There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment\n",
       "of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt,\n",
       "I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health\n",
       "had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have performed\n",
       "delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?\"\n",
       "\n",

       "She practises very constantly.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write\n",
       "to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often\n",
       "tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without\n",
       "constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she\n",
       "will never play really well unless she practises more; and though Mrs.\n",
       "Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told\n",
       "her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.\n",

       "When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having\n",
       "promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He\n",
       "drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then\n",
       "talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away\n",
       "from her, and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte\n",
       "stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's\n",
       "countenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first\n",
       "convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear\n",
       "me? I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well. There\n",
       "is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the\n",
       "will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate\n",
       "me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I shall not say you are mistaken,\" he replied, \"because you could not\n",
       "really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have\n",
       "had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find\n",
       "great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are\n",
       "not your own.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to\n",
       "Colonel Fitzwilliam, \"Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of\n",
       "me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky\n",
       "in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character, in a part\n",
       "of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of\n",
       "credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all\n",
       "that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me leave to\n",
       "say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such\n",
       "things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am not afraid of you,\" said he, smilingly.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,\" cried Colonel\n",
       "Fitzwilliam. \"I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.\n",
       "The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know,\n",
       "was at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced\n",
       "only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain\n",
       "knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a\n",
       "partner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly\n",
       "beyond my own party.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, Colonel\n",
       "Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Perhaps,\" said Darcy, \"I should have judged better, had I sought an\n",
       "introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?\" said Elizabeth, still\n",
       "addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. \"Shall we ask him why a man of sense and\n",
       "education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend\n",
       "himself to strangers?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I can answer your question,\" said Fitzwilliam, \"without applying to\n",
       "him. It is because he will not give himself the trouble.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,\" said Darcy,\n",
       "\"of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot\n",
       "catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their\n",
       "concerns, as I often see done.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My fingers,\" said Elizabeth, \"do not move over this instrument in the\n",
       "masterly manner which I see so many women's do. They have not the same\n",
       "force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I\n",
       "have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I will not take the\n",
       "trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as\n",
       "capable as any other woman's of superior execution.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Darcy smiled and said, \"You are perfectly right. You have employed your\n",
       "time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can\n",
       "think anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know\n",
       "what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again.\n",
       "Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said\n",
       "to Darcy:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and\n",
       "could have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion\n",
       "of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne's. Anne would have\n",
       "been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss\n",
       "de Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have\n",

       "Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing\n",

       "I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the\n",

       "\n",
       "\"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond\n",

       "\"I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her\n",
       "family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many\n",
       "varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expenses of\n",
       "travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the\n",
       "case _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not\n",
       "such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my\n",

       "the present distance.\"\n",

       "Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, \"_You_ cannot\n",

       "been always at Longbourn.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of\n",

       "calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte\n",
       "and her sister, just returned from her walk. The tete-a-tete surprised\n",
       "them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding\n",
       "on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying\n",
       "much to anybody, went away.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What can be the meaning of this?\" said Charlotte, as soon as he was\n",

       "\n",
       "But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,\n",
       "even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various\n",
       "conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from\n",
       "the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable\n",
       "from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there\n",
       "was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot\n",
       "always be within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the\n",
       "pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the\n",
       "two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither\n",
       "almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes\n",
       "separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their\n",
       "aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he\n",
       "had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended\n",
       "him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in\n",
       "being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her\n",
       "former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw\n",
       "there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners,\n",
       "she believed he might have the best informed mind.\n",
       "\n",
       "But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult\n",
       "to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there\n",
       "ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak,\n",
       "it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice\n",
       "to propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really\n",
       "animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel\n",
       "Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was\n",
       "generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told\n",
       "her; and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect\n",
       "of love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself\n",
       "seriously to work to find it out. She watched him whenever they were at\n",
       "Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He\n",
       "certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that\n",
       "look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often\n",
       "doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it\n",
       "seemed nothing but absence of mind.\n",
       "\n",
       "She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his\n",
       "being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.\n",
       "Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of\n",
       "raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her\n",
       "opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would\n",

       "\n",
       "\n",
       "In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying\n",
       "Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the most pleasant man; he\n",
       "certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,\n",
       "to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage\n",

       "prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first that\n",
       "it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time,\n",
       "therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like\n",
       "wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was\n",
       "not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,\n",

       "\"I did not know before that you ever walked this way.\"\n",

       "\"I have been making the tour of the park,\" he replied, \"as I generally\n",

       "you going much farther?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, I should have turned in a moment.\"\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",
       "\"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least\n",
       "pleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems\n",
       "more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He likes to have his own way very well,\" replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.\n",
       "\"But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it\n",
       "than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak\n",
       "feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and\n",
       "dependence.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of\n",
       "either. Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and\n",
       "dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going\n",
       "wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy for?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have\n",
       "experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater\n",

       "money.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Is this,\" thought Elizabeth, \"meant for me?\" and she coloured at the\n",
       "idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, \"And pray, what\n",
       "is the usual price of an earl's younger son? Unless the elder brother is\n",
       "very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt\n",
       "a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,\n",
       "she soon afterwards said:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of\n",
       "having someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a\n",
       "lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well\n",
       "for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he\n",
       "likes with her.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No,\" said Colonel Fitzwilliam, \"that is an advantage which he must\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Are you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your\n",
       "charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes a\n",
       "little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she\n",
       "may like to have her own way.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner\n",
       "in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to\n",
       "give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other\n",
       "got pretty near the truth. She directly replied:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare\n",
       "say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a\n",
       "very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and\n",
       "Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man--he\n",
       "is a great friend of Darcy's.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! yes,\" said Elizabeth drily; \"Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.\n",
       "Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in\n",
       "those points where he most wants care. From something that he told me in\n",
       "our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to\n",
       "him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that\n",
       "Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What is it you mean?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known,\n",
       "because if it were to get round to the lady's family, it would be an\n",
       "unpleasant thing.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You may depend upon my not mentioning it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be\n",
       "Bingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself\n",
       "on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most\n",
       "imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other\n",
       "particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing\n",
       "him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from\n",
       "knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I understood that there were some very strong objections against the\n",
       "lady.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And what arts did he use to separate them?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He did not talk to me of his own arts,\" said Fitzwilliam, smiling. \"He\n",
       "only told me what I have now told you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with\n",
       "indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she\n",
       "was so thoughtful.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am thinking of what you have been telling me,\" said she. \"Your\n",
       "cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his\n",
       "friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgement alone, he was to\n",
       "determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy.\n",
       "But,\" she continued, recollecting herself, \"as we know none of the\n",
       "particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed\n",
       "that there was much affection in the case.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That is not an unnatural surmise,\" said Fitzwilliam, \"but it is a\n",
       "lessening of the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a picture\n",
       "of Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer, and\n",
       "therefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent\n",
       "matters until they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room,\n",
       "as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption\n",
       "of all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other\n",
       "people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There\n",
       "could not exist in the world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have\n",
       "such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures\n",
       "taken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had\n",
       "always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement\n",
       "of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, _he_ was\n",
       "the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had\n",
       "suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a while\n",
       "every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the\n",
       "world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"There were some very strong objections against the lady,\" were Colonel\n",
       "Fitzwilliam's words; and those strong objections probably were, her\n",
       "having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in\n",
       "business in London.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"To Jane herself,\" she exclaimed, \"there could be no possibility of\n",
       "objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!--her understanding\n",
       "excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither\n",
       "could anything be urged against my father, who, though with some\n",
       "peculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and\n",
       "respectability which he will probably never reach.\" When she thought of\n",
       "her mother, her confidence gave way a little; but she would not allow\n",
       "that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose\n",
       "pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of\n",
       "importance in his friend's connections, than from their want of sense;\n",
       "and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly governed\n",
       "by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr.\n",
       "Bingley for his sister.\n",
       "\n",
       "The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a\n",

       "cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins,\n",
       "seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go and as much\n",
       "as possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins\n",

       "When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself\n",
       "as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the\n",
       "examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her\n",
       "being in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any\n",
       "revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.\n",
       "But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that\n",
       "cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style, and which,\n",
       "proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly\n",
       "disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth\n",
       "noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an\n",
       "attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy's\n",
       "shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her\n",

       "to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the\n",
       "next--and, a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should\n",

       "mean to be unhappy about him.\n",
       "\n",
       "While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the\n",

       "the evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her.\n",
       "But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently\n",
       "affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the\n",
       "room. In an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her\n",
       "health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.\n",
       "She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and\n",

       "Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,\n",
       "doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement;\n",
       "and the avowal of all that he felt, and had long felt for her,\n",
       "immediately followed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides\n",
       "those of the heart to be detailed; and he was not more eloquent on the\n",
       "subject of tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority--of\n",
       "its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which had always\n",
       "opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to\n",
       "the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his\n",
       "suit.\n",
       "\n",
       "In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to\n",
       "the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did\n",
       "not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to\n",
       "receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she\n",
       "lost all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to\n",
       "answer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with\n",
       "representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite\n",
       "of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with\n",
       "expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of\n",
       "his hand. As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt\n",
       "of a favourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but\n",
       "his countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could\n",
       "only exasperate farther, and, when he ceased, the colour rose into her\n",
       "cheeks, and she said:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to\n",
       "express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however\n",
       "unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should\n",
       "be felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you. But I\n",
       "cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly\n",
       "bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to\n",
       "anyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be\n",
       "of short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented\n",
       "the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in\n",
       "overcoming it after this explanation.\"\n",

       "Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed\n",
       "on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than\n",
       "surprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance\n",
       "of his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the\n",
       "appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed\n",
       "himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings\n",
       "dreadful. At length, with a voice of forced calmness, he said:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting!\n",
       "I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at\n",
       "civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I might as well inquire,\" replied she, \"why with so evident a desire\n",
       "of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me\n",
       "against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?\n",
       "Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I have\n",
       "other provocations. You know I have. Had not my feelings decided against\n",
       "you--had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you\n",
       "think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has\n",
       "been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most\n",
       "beloved sister?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion\n",
       "was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she\n",
       "continued:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can\n",
       "excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You dare not,\n",
       "you cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if not the only means\n",
       "of dividing them from each other--of exposing one to the censure of the\n",
       "world for caprice and instability, and the other to its derision for\n",
       "disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest\n",
       "kind.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening\n",
       "with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.\n",
       "He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Can you deny that you have done it?\" she repeated.\n",
       "\n",
       "With assumed tranquillity he then replied: \"I have no wish of denying\n",
       "that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your\n",
       "sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_ I have been\n",
       "kinder than towards myself.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,\n",
       "but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But it is not merely this affair,\" she continued, \"on which my dislike\n",
       "is founded. Long before it had taken place my opinion of you was\n",
       "decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received\n",
       "many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to\n",
       "say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?\n",
       "or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns,\" said Darcy,\n",
       "in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an\n",
       "interest in him?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"His misfortunes!\" repeated Darcy contemptuously; \"yes, his misfortunes\n",
       "have been great indeed.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And of your infliction,\" cried Elizabeth with energy. \"You have reduced\n",
       "him to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty. You have\n",
       "withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for\n",
       "him. You have deprived the best years of his life of that independence\n",
       "which was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this!\n",
       "and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and\n",
       "ridicule.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And this,\" cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,\n",
       "\"is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me!\n",
       "I thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this\n",
       "calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,\" added he, stopping in\n",
       "his walk, and turning towards her, \"these offenses might have been\n",
       "overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the\n",
       "scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These\n",
       "bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater\n",
       "policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of\n",
       "my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by\n",
       "reflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.\n",
       "Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and\n",
       "just. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your\n",
       "connections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose\n",
       "condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to\n",
       "the utmost to speak with composure when she said:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your\n",
       "declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern\n",
       "which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more\n",
       "gentlemanlike manner.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that\n",
       "would have tempted me to accept it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an\n",
       "expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"From the very beginning--from the first moment, I may almost say--of\n",
       "my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest\n",
       "belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of\n",
       "the feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of\n",
       "disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a\n",
       "dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the\n",
       "last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your\n",
       "feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.\n",
       "Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best\n",
       "wishes for your health and happiness.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him\n",
       "the next moment open the front door and quit the house.\n",
       "\n",
       "The tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She knew not how\n",
       "to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for\n",
       "half-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed,\n",
       "was increased by every review of it. That she should receive an offer of\n",
       "marriage from Mr. Darcy! That he should have been in love with her for\n",
       "so many months! So much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of\n",
       "all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying\n",
       "her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his\n",
       "own case--was almost incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired\n",
       "unconsciously so strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable\n",
       "pride--his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to\n",
       "Jane--his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could\n",
       "not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr.\n",
       "Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon\n",
       "overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for\n",
       "a moment excited. She continued in very agitated reflections till the\n",
       "sound of Lady Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to\n",
       "encounter Charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room.\n",

       "\n",
       "Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations\n",
       "which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the\n",
       "surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anything\n",
       "else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved, soon after\n",
       "breakfast, to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding\n",
       "directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy's\n",
       "sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,\n",
       "she turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road. The\n",
       "park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one\n",
       "of the gates into the ground.\n",
       "\n",
       "After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was\n",
       "tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and\n",
       "look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had\n",
       "made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the\n",
       "verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk,\n",
       "when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which\n",
       "edged the park; he was moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr.\n",
       "Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now\n",
       "near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced\n",
       "her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called, though\n",
       "in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the\n",
       "gate. He had by that time reached it also, and, holding out a letter,\n",
       "which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty composure,\n",
       "\"I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.\n",
       "Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?\" And then, with a\n",
       "slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.\n",
       "\n",
       "With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,\n",
       "Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder,\n",
       "perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper, written\n",
       "quite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise\n",
       "full. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated\n",
       "from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension\n",
       "of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those\n",
       "offers which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any\n",
       "intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes\n",
       "which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the\n",
       "effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,\n",
       "should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written\n",
       "and read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand\n",
       "your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I\n",
       "demand it of your justice.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equal\n",
       "magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was,\n",
       "that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley\n",
       "from your sister, and the other, that I had, in defiance of various\n",
       "claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate\n",
       "prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and\n",
       "wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged\n",
       "favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other\n",
       "dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect\n",
       "its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young\n",
       "persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could\n",
       "bear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last\n",
       "night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope\n",
       "to be in the future secured, when the following account of my actions\n",
       "and their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them, which\n",
       "is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which\n",
       "may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity\n",
       "must be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with\n",
       "others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young\n",
       "woman in the country. But it was not till the evening of the dance\n",
       "at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious\n",
       "attachment. I had often seen him in love before. At that ball, while I\n",
       "had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir\n",
       "William Lucas's accidental information, that Bingley's attentions to\n",
       "your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage.\n",
       "He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could\n",
       "be undecided. From that moment I observed my friend's behaviour\n",
       "attentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss\n",
       "Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also\n",
       "watched. Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever,\n",
       "but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced\n",
       "from the evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions\n",
       "with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of\n",
       "sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have been\n",
       "in error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter\n",
       "probable. If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to inflict\n",
       "pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I shall not\n",
       "scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister's countenance and\n",
       "air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction\n",
       "that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be\n",
       "easily touched. That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is\n",
       "certain--but I will venture to say that my investigation and decisions\n",
       "are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did not believe\n",
       "her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on impartial\n",
       "conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My objections to the\n",
       "marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have\n",
       "the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of\n",
       "connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. But\n",
       "there were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though still\n",
       "existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had\n",
       "myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before\n",
       "me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The situation of your\n",
       "mother's family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison to that\n",
       "total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by\n",
       "herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your\n",
       "father. Pardon me. It pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern\n",
       "for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this\n",
       "representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to\n",
       "have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure,\n",
       "is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister, than\n",
       "it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. I will only say\n",
       "farther that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties\n",
       "was confirmed, and every inducement heightened which could have led\n",
       "me before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy\n",
       "connection. He left Netherfield for London, on the day following, as\n",
       "you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters' uneasiness\n",
       "had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was\n",
       "soon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in\n",
       "detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in\n",
       "London. We accordingly went--and there I readily engaged in the office\n",
       "of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. I\n",
       "described, and enforced them earnestly. But, however this remonstrance\n",
       "might have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose\n",
       "that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been\n",
       "seconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your\n",
       "sister's indifference. He had before believed her to return his\n",
       "affection with sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great\n",
       "natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his\n",
       "own. To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was\n",
       "no very difficult point. To persuade him against returning into\n",
       "Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the\n",
       "work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for having done thus much. There\n",
       "is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not\n",
       "reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the\n",
       "measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being in\n",
       "town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her\n",
       "brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might have met without\n",
       "ill consequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me\n",
       "enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this\n",
       "concealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however, and it\n",
       "was done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more to say, no\n",
       "other apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister's feelings, it\n",
       "was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to\n",
       "you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn\n",
       "them.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured\n",

       "connection with my family. Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I\n",
       "am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more\n",
       "than one witness of undoubted veracity.\n",

       "been unable to give him a gentleman's education. My father was not only\n",
       "fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always engaging; he\n",
       "had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be\n",

       "careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape\n",
       "the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself,\n",
       "and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr.\n",

       "that his profession might allow--and if he took orders, desired that a\n",
       "valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There\n",
       "was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long\n",
       "survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham\n",
       "wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders,\n",
       "he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more\n",
       "immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he\n",
       "could not be benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying\n",
       "law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would\n",
       "be a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than believed\n",
       "him to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to\n",
       "his proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman; the\n",
       "business was therefore soon settled--he resigned all claim to assistance\n",
       "in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to\n",
       "receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection\n",
       "between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him\n",
       "to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town I believe he chiefly\n",
       "lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free\n",
       "from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.\n",
       "For about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the\n",
       "incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to\n",
       "me again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he assured\n",
       "me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. He\n",
       "had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely\n",
       "resolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in\n",
       "question--of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was\n",
       "well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not\n",
       "have forgotten my revered father's intentions. You will hardly blame\n",
       "me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every\n",
       "repetition to it. His resentment was in proportion to the distress of\n",
       "his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me\n",
       "to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this period every\n",
       "appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived I know not. But\n",

       "About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed\n",
       "for her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided\n",
       "over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by\n",
       "design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him\n",
       "and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and\n",
       "by her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,\n",
       "whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to\n",
       "her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and\n",
       "to consent to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her\n",

       "the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two\n",

       "a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and\n",
       "how I acted. Regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented\n",
       "any public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place\n",
       "immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr.\n",
       "Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune, which\n",

       "had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved\n",
       "very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold\n",
       "luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated\n",
       "you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never\n",
       "should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then\n",
       "we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that\n",
       "anybody might have heard us ten miles off!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "To this Mary very gravely replied, \"Far be it from me, my dear sister,\n",

       "_me_--I should infinitely prefer a book.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to\n",
       "anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk\n",
       "to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily\n",
       "opposed the scheme. It should not be said that the Miss Bennets could\n",
       "not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.\n",
       "There was another reason too for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Mr.\n",
       "Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The\n",
       "comfort to _her_ of the regiment's approaching removal was indeed beyond\n",
       "expression. In a fortnight they were to go--and once gone, she hoped\n",
       "there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.\n",
       "\n",
       "She had not been many hours at home before she found that the Brighton\n",
       "scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under\n",
       "frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her\n",
       "father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were\n",
       "at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often\n",
       "disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.\n",

       "who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that\n",
       "so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here\n",
       "collected in one individual. Nor was Darcy's vindication, though\n",

       "consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the\n",
       "knowledge of your ill opinion, too! and having to relate such a thing\n",

       "so.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "\"Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most\n",

       "\n",
       "\"That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised me\n",
       "to make his communication public. On the contrary, every particular\n",
       "relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to\n",
       "myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his\n",
       "conduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy\n",
       "is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in\n",
       "Meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal\n",
       "to it. Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to\n",
       "anyone here what he really is. Some time hence it will be all found out,\n",
       "and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At\n",
       "present I will say nothing about it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for\n",
       "ever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to\n",
       "re-establish a character. We must not make him desperate.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation. She had\n",
       "got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight,\n",
       "and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish\n",
       "to talk again of either. But there was still something lurking behind,\n",
       "of which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not relate the other\n",
       "half of Mr. Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she\n",
       "had been valued by her friend. Here was knowledge in which no one\n",
       "could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect\n",
       "understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off\n",
       "this last encumbrance of mystery. \"And then,\" said she, \"if that very\n",
       "improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to\n",

       "\n",
       "She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real\n",
       "state of her sister's spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished a\n",
       "very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself\n",
       "in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment,\n",
       "and, from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than most first\n",
       "attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance,\n",
       "and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her\n",
       "attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the\n",
       "indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own\n",
       "health and their tranquillity.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, Lizzy,\" said Mrs. Bennet one day, \"what is your opinion _now_ of\n",
       "this sad business of Jane's? For my part, I am determined never to speak\n",
       "of it again to anybody. I told my sister Phillips so the other day. But\n",
       "I cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London. Well, he is\n",
       "a very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there's the least\n",
       "chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of\n",
       "his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of\n",
       "everybody, too, who is likely to know.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come. Though I\n",
       "shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I\n",
       "would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will\n",
       "die of a broken heart; and then he will be sorry for what he has done.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation,\n",
       "she made no answer.\n",
       "\n",

       "Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope\n",
       "it will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an\n",

       "for money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often\n",

       "in the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost\n",
       "universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,\n",

       "flew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone's\n",
       "congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;\n",
       "whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate\n",
       "in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.\n",
       "\n",

       "considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense\n",
       "for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it\n",
       "known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her\n",
       "go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general\n",
       "behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of\n",
       "such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more\n",
       "imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must\n",
       "be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public\n",

       "\n",

       "of particular, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our\n",
       "importance, our respectability in the world must be affected by the\n",
       "wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark\n",
       "Lydia's character. Excuse me, for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear\n",
       "father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and\n",
       "of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of\n",
       "her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character\n",
       "will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt\n",
       "that ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the\n",
       "worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond\n",
       "youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness\n",
       "of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal\n",
       "contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger\n",
       "Kitty also is comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,\n",
       "ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father, can you\n",
       "suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever\n",
       "they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the\n",
       "disgrace?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and\n",
       "affectionately taking her hand said in reply:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known\n",
       "you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less\n",
       "advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three--very silly\n",
       "sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to\n",
       "Brighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will\n",
       "keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an\n",
       "object of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance\n",
       "even as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find\n",
       "women better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being\n",
       "there may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow\n",

       "\n",
       "With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion\n",
       "continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not\n",
       "in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on\n",
       "them. She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret\n",
       "over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her\n",

       "present plan, were to go no farther northwards than Derbyshire. In that\n",
       "county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three\n",

       "thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such\n",

       "curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the\n",
       "next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and\n",

       "high woody hills; and in front, a stream of some natural importance was\n",
       "swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks\n",
       "were neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She\n",
       "had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural\n",

       "to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, which\n",
       "they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance,\n",

       "seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to\n",

       "these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of\n",
       "viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and\n",
       "welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But no,\"--recollecting\n",
       "herself--\"that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to\n",
       "me; I should not have been allowed to invite them.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something very like\n",
       "regret.\n",
       "\n",
       "She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really\n",
       "absent, but had not the courage for it. At length however, the question\n",
       "was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs.\n",
       "Reynolds replied that he was, adding, \"But we expect him to-morrow, with\n",
       "a large party of friends.\" How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own\n",
       "journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!\n",
       "\n",
       "Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached and saw the\n",
       "likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other miniatures,\n",
       "over the mantelpiece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.\n",
       "The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was a picture of a young\n",
       "gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been brought\n",
       "up by him at his own expense. \"He is now gone into the army,\" she added;\n",
       "\"but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not\n",
       "return it.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And that,\" said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,\n",
       "\"is my master--and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the\n",
       "other--about eight years ago.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have heard much of your master's fine person,\" said Mrs. Gardiner,\n",
       "looking at the picture; \"it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell\n",
       "us whether it is like or not.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this\n",
       "intimation of her knowing her master.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth coloured, and said: \"A little.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma'am?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, very handsome.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you\n",
       "will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late\n",
       "master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to\n",
       "be then. He was very fond of them.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being among them.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn\n",
       "when she was only eight years old.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?\" said Mrs. Gardiner.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so\n",
       "accomplished!--She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is\n",
       "a new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she\n",
       "comes here to-morrow with him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her\n",
       "communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either\n",
       "by pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her\n",
       "master and his sister.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend half his\n",
       "time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Except,\" thought Elizabeth, \"when she goes to Ramsgate.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"If your master would marry, you might see more of him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know who is\n",
       "good enough for him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, \"It is\n",
       "very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows him,\"\n",
       "replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she\n",
       "listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, \"I have\n",
       "never known a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever\n",
       "since he was four years old.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her\n",
       "ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.\n",
       "Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was\n",
       "grateful to her uncle for saying:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in\n",
       "having such a master.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could\n",
       "not meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are\n",
       "good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and\n",
       "he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the\n",
       "world.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth almost stared at her. \"Can this be Mr. Darcy?\" thought she.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"His father was an excellent man,\" said Mrs. Gardiner.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just\n",
       "as affable to the poor.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs.\n",
       "Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects\n",
       "of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the\n",
       "furniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family\n",
       "prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her\n",
       "master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his\n",
       "many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He is the best landlord, and the best master,\" said she, \"that ever\n",
       "lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of nothing but\n",
       "themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but will give\n",
       "him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw\n",
       "anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away\n",
       "like other young men.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"In what an amiable light does this place him!\" thought Elizabeth.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"This fine account of him,\" whispered her aunt as they walked, \"is not\n",
       "quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Perhaps we might be deceived.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That is not very likely; our authority was too good.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty\n",
       "sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than\n",
       "the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to\n",
       "give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room when\n",
       "last at Pemberley.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He is certainly a good brother,\" said Elizabeth, as she walked towards\n",
       "one of the windows.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should enter\n",
       "the room. \"And this is always the way with him,\" she added. \"Whatever\n",
       "can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment. There\n",
       "is nothing he would not do for her.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms, were\n",
       "all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings;\n",
       "but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already\n",
       "visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss\n",
       "Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and\n",
       "also more intelligible.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have\n",
       "little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked in quest of\n",
       "the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it arrested\n",
       "her--and she beheld a striking resemblance to Mr. Darcy, with such a\n",
       "smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he\n",
       "looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest\n",
       "contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.\n",
       "Mrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father's\n",
       "lifetime.\n",
       "\n",
       "There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle\n",
       "sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of\n",
       "their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds\n",
       "was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise\n",
       "of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she\n",
       "considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--how\n",
       "much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!--how much of\n",
       "good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought\n",
       "forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she\n",
       "stood before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his\n",
       "eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of\n",
       "gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and\n",
       "softened its impropriety of expression.\n",
       "\n",
       "When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,\n",
       "they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were\n",
       "consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall-door.\n",
       "\n",
       "As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth turned back\n",
       "to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former\n",
       "was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself\n",
       "suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.\n",
       "\n",
       "They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his\n",
       "appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes\n",
       "instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest\n",
       "blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from\n",
       "surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,\n",
       "and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least\n",
       "of perfect civility.\n",
       "\n",
       "She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,\n",
       "received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be\n",
       "overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture\n",
       "they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two\n",
       "that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on\n",
       "beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little\n",
       "aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,\n",
       "scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer\n",
       "she returned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the\n",
       "alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that\n",
       "he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the\n",
       "impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few\n",
       "minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in\n",
       "her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent\n",
       "had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his inquiries as\n",
       "to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her having stayed in\n",
       "Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the\n",
       "distraction of his thoughts.\n",
       "\n",
       "At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few\n",
       "moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took\n",
       "leave.\n",
       "\n",
       "The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his figure; but\n",
       "Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her own feelings,\n",
       "followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and vexation. Her\n",
       "coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the\n",
       "world! How strange it must appear to him! In what a disgraceful light\n",
       "might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely\n",
       "thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he\n",
       "thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes\n",
       "sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination;\n",
       "for it was plain that he was that moment arrived--that moment alighted\n",
       "from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and again over\n",
       "the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so strikingly\n",
       "altered--what could it mean? That he should even speak to her was\n",
       "amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her family!\n",
       "Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never\n",
       "had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What\n",
       "a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put\n",
       "his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to account\n",
       "for it.\n",
       "\n",
       "They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and\n",
       "every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer\n",
       "reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time\n",
       "before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered\n",
       "mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and\n",
       "seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she\n",
       "distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that\n",
       "one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then\n",
       "was. She longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind--in\n",
       "what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,\n",
       "she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he\n",
       "felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice which was\n",
       "not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in\n",
       "seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with\n",
       "composure.\n",
       "\n",
       "At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind\n",
       "aroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.\n",
       "\n",
       "They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,\n",
       "ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where the opening of\n",
       "the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the\n",
       "valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading\n",
       "many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish\n",
       "of going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk.\n",
       "With a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round.\n",
       "It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which\n",
       "brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods,\n",
       "to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They crossed\n",
       "it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene;\n",
       "it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the\n",
       "valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream,\n",
       "and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it.\n",
       "Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the\n",
       "bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,\n",
       "who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only\n",
       "of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,\n",
       "therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house\n",
       "on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their\n",
       "progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the\n",
       "taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the\n",
       "occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the\n",
       "man about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this\n",
       "slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment\n",
       "was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy\n",
       "approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here\n",
       "less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before\n",
       "they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared\n",
       "for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with\n",
       "calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,\n",
       "she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea\n",
       "lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the\n",
       "turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance, she saw\n",
       "that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his\n",
       "politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;\n",
       "but she had not got beyond the words \"delightful,\" and \"charming,\" when\n",
       "some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of\n",
       "Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed,\n",
       "and she said no more.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked\n",
       "her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.\n",
       "This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared;\n",
       "and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the\n",
       "acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had\n",
       "revolted in his offer to herself. \"What will be his surprise,\" thought\n",
       "she, \"when he knows who they are? He takes them now for people of\n",
       "fashion.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their\n",
       "relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore\n",
       "it, and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he\n",
       "could from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the\n",
       "connection was evident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and\n",
       "so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into\n",
       "conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,\n",
       "could not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had\n",
       "some relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most\n",
       "attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every\n",
       "expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,\n",
       "his taste, or his good manners.\n",
       "\n",
       "The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy\n",
       "invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he\n",
       "chose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time\n",
       "to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of\n",
       "the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was\n",
       "walking arm-in-arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder.\n",
       "Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment\n",
       "must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and\n",
       "continually was she repeating, \"Why is he so altered? From what can\n",
       "it proceed? It cannot be for _me_--it cannot be for _my_ sake that his\n",
       "manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a\n",
       "change as this. It is impossible that he should still love me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two\n",
       "gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to\n",
       "the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious\n",
       "water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated\n",
       "in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found\n",
       "Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred\n",
       "her husband's. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on\n",
       "together. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him\n",
       "to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the\n",
       "place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been\n",
       "very unexpected--\"for your housekeeper,\" she added, \"informed us that\n",
       "you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we\n",
       "left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected\n",
       "in the country.\" He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that\n",
       "business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours\n",
       "before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. \"They\n",
       "will join me early to-morrow,\" he continued, \"and among them are some\n",
       "who will claim an acquaintance with you--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly\n",
       "driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley's name had been the last\n",
       "mentioned between them; and, if she might judge by his complexion, _his_\n",
       "mind was not very differently engaged.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"There is also one other person in the party,\" he continued after a\n",
       "pause, \"who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow\n",
       "me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance\n",
       "during your stay at Lambton?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great\n",
       "for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt\n",
       "that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her\n",
       "must be the work of her brother, and, without looking farther, it was\n",
       "satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made\n",
       "him think really ill of her.\n",
       "\n",
       "They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth\n",
       "was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and\n",
       "pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of\n",
       "the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they had\n",
       "reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a\n",
       "mile behind.\n",
       "\n",
       "He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not\n",
       "tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might\n",
       "have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but\n",
       "there seemed to be an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected\n",
       "that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale\n",
       "with great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her\n",
       "patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tete-a-tete was\n",
       "over. On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's coming up they were all pressed to go\n",
       "into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and\n",
       "they parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the\n",
       "ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him\n",
       "walking slowly towards the house.\n",
       "\n",
       "The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them\n",
       "pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.\n",
       "\"He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming,\" said her uncle.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"There _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,\" replied her\n",
       "aunt, \"but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now\n",
       "say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, I\n",
       "have seen nothing of it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more\n",
       "than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such\n",
       "attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"To be sure, Lizzy,\" said her aunt, \"he is not so handsome as Wickham;\n",
       "or, rather, he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features\n",
       "are perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he was so\n",
       "disagreeable?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked\n",
       "him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that she had never\n",
       "seen him so pleasant as this morning.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,\" replied\n",
       "her uncle. \"Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him\n",
       "at his word, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off\n",
       "his grounds.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character, but\n",
       "said nothing.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"From what we have seen of him,\" continued Mrs. Gardiner, \"I really\n",
       "should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by\n",
       "anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look.\n",
       "On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he\n",
       "speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance that would\n",
       "not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the\n",
       "good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character!\n",
       "I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal\n",
       "master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every\n",
       "virtue.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of\n",
       "his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in\n",
       "as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from\n",
       "his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different\n",
       "construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor\n",
       "Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In\n",
       "confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary\n",
       "transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming\n",
       "her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now\n",
       "approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to\n",
       "the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out\n",
       "to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of\n",
       "anything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk they\n",
       "had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former\n",
       "acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of a\n",
       "intercourse renewed after many years' discontinuance.\n",
       "\n",
       "The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth\n",
       "much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing\n",
       "but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy's civility, and, above\n",
       "all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.\n",

       "her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently\n",
       "resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.\n",
       "But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their\n",
       "arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the\n",

       "to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a\n",
       "carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in\n",
       "a curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing\n",
       "the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her\n",
       "surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she\n",
       "expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment\n",
       "of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many\n",
       "of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on\n",
       "the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt that\n",
       "there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a\n",
       "quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these\n",
       "newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of\n",
       "Elizabeth's feelings was at every moment increasing. She was quite\n",
       "amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet,\n",
       "she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much\n",
       "in her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally\n",
       "suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction\n",
       "took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new\n",
       "acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her\n",
       "being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;\n",
       "but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was\n",
       "only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from\n",
       "her beyond a monosyllable.\n",
       "\n",
       "Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though\n",
       "little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance\n",
       "womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother; but there\n",
       "was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly\n",
       "unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as\n",
       "acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much\n",
       "relieved by discerning such different feelings.\n",
       "\n",

       "was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her\n",
       "satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick\n",
       "step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All\n",
       "Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but had she still\n",
       "felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected\n",
       "cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He\n",
       "inquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked\n",
       "and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.\n",
       "\n",
       "To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage\n",
       "than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before\n",

       "arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece directed their observation towards\n",
       "each with an earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from\n",
       "those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew\n",
       "what it was to love. Of the lady's sensations they remained a little\n",
       "in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was\n",
       "evident enough.\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the\n",

       "to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she\n",
       "feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she\n",
       "endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley\n",

       "how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in\n",

       "former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion\n",
       "that, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But,\n",
       "though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his\n",
       "behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look\n",
       "appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred\n",

       "recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying\n",
       "more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed\n",
       "to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone\n",
       "which had something of real regret, that it \"was a very long time since\n",
       "he had had the pleasure of seeing her;\" and, before she could reply,\n",
       "he added, \"It is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of\n",

       "\n",
       "Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards\n",
       "took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether\n",
       "_all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question,\n",
       "nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which\n",
       "gave them meaning.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself;\n",
       "but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general\n",
       "complaisance, and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed\n",
       "from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that\n",
       "the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however\n",
       "temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When\n",
       "she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion\n",
       "of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a\n",
       "disgrace--when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the\n",
       "very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last\n",
       "lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage--the difference, the change was\n",
       "so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly\n",
       "restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company\n",
       "of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations\n",
       "at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from\n",
       "self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance\n",
       "could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the\n",
       "acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw\n",
       "down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and\n",

       "Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they arose\n",

       "their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner\n",
       "at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a\n",
       "diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,\n",
       "readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing\n",
       "how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its\n",
       "acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming however,\n",
       "that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than\n",
       "any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of\n",
       "society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for\n",
       "her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.\n",
       "\n",
       "Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth\n",
       "again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to\n",
       "make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all\n",
       "this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and on\n",
       "this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their\n",
       "visitors left them, capable of considering the last half-hour with some\n",
       "satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been\n",
       "little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her\n",
       "uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their\n",
       "favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.\n",
       "\n",
       "But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity; it was\n",
       "not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was\n",
       "much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;\n",
       "it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to\n",
       "interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.\n",
       "\n",
       "Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far\n",
       "as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could\n",
       "not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character\n",
       "from their own feelings and his servant's report, without any reference\n",
       "to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known\n",
       "would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,\n",
       "however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible\n",
       "that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four\n",
       "years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be\n",
       "hastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of\n",
       "their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had\n",
       "nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not,\n",
       "it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town\n",
       "where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he\n",
       "was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.\n",
       "\n",
       "With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held\n",
       "there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the\n",
       "son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known\n",

       "As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than\n",
       "the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not\n",
       "long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion;\n",
       "and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out. She\n",
       "certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she\n",
       "had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,\n",
       "that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his\n",
       "valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some\n",
       "time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightened\n",
       "into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in\n",
       "his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,\n",
       "which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,\n",
       "there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked.\n",
       "It was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having once loved her,\n",
       "but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and\n",
       "acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations\n",
       "accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid\n",
       "her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most\n",
       "eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display\n",
       "of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only\n",
       "were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent\n",
       "on making her known to his sister. Such a change in a man of so much\n",
       "pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent\n",
       "love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a\n",
       "sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be\n",
       "exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him,\n",

       "In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there\n",
       "with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in\n",
       "London. Georgiana's reception of them was very civil, but attended with\n",
       "all the embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear\n",
       "of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior\n",
       "the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece,\n",
       "however, did her justice, and pitied her.\n",
       "\n",
       "By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey; and,\n",
       "on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,\n",

       "genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind\n",
       "of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the\n",
       "others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from\n",
       "Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she\n",
       "wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a\n",
       "short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,\n",
       "and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without\n",
       "calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her\n",
       "from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an\n",
       "inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity\n",
       "of saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every\n",
       "moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she\n",
       "feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether\n",
       "she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After\n",
       "sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss\n",
       "Bingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold\n",
       "inquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal\n",
       "indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.\n",
       "\n",
       "The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the\n",
       "entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the\n",
       "finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many\n",
       "a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been\n",
       "given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole\n",
       "party--for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the\n",
       "beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected\n",
       "them round the table.\n",
       "\n",
       "While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether\n",
       "she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the\n",
       "feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but\n",
       "a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to\n",
       "regret that he came.\n",
       "\n",
       "He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other\n",
       "gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him\n",
       "only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to\n",
       "Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely\n",
       "resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more\n",
       "necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she\n",
       "saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,\n",
       "and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour\n",
       "when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive\n",
       "curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the\n",
       "smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its\n",
       "objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions\n",
       "to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother's\n",
       "entrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he\n",
       "was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded\n",
       "as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss\n",
       "Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the\n",
       "first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire Militia removed from Meryton?\n",
       "They must be a great loss to _your_ family.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth\n",
       "instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the\n",
       "various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress;\n",
       "but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she\n",
       "presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone. While\n",
       "she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a heightened\n",
       "complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with\n",
       "confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what\n",
       "pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would\n",
       "have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose\n",
       "Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed\n",
       "her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in\n",
       "Darcy's opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies\n",
       "and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected\n",
       "with that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's\n",
       "meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy\n",
       "was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections\n",
       "her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very\n",
       "wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming\n",
       "hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without\n",
       "meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss\n",
       "Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern\n",
       "for the welfare of his friend.\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and\n",
       "as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to\n",
       "Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able\n",
       "to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely\n",
       "recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which\n",
       "had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have\n",
       "fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.\n",
       "\n",
       "Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above\n",
       "mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage Miss\n",
       "Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person,\n",
       "behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her brother's\n",
       "recommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not\n",
       "err. And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana\n",
       "without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When\n",
       "Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to\n",

       "\n",
       "\"How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,\" she\n",
       "cried; \"I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since\n",

       "that we should not have known her again.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented\n",
       "himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than\n",
       "her being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the\n",
       "summer.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"For my own part,\" she rejoined, \"I must confess that I never could\n",
       "see any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no\n",
       "brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose\n",
       "wants character--there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are\n",
       "tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes,\n",
       "which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never see anything\n",
       "extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do\n",
       "not like at all; and in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency\n",
       "without fashion, which is intolerable.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not\n",
       "the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always\n",
       "wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the\n",
       "success she expected. He was resolutely silent, however, and, from a\n",
       "determination of making him speak, she continued:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all\n",
       "were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect\n",
       "your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, '_She_\n",
       "a beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.' But afterwards she\n",
       "seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at\n",
       "one time.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes,\" replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, \"but _that_\n",
       "was only when I first saw her, for it is many months since I have\n",
       "considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.\"\n",

       "Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their\n",
       "visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them\n",
       "both. The look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed,\n",
       "except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked\n",
       "of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit--of everything but\n",
       "himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of\n",

       "assured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.\n",
       "An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed,\n",
       "from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland\n",
       "with one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our\n",

       "disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.\n",
       "Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How\n",
       "thankful am I that we never let them know what has been said against\n",
       "him; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about\n",
       "twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at\n",
       "eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have\n",
       "passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect\n",
       "him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of\n",
       "their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor\n",

       "wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my\n",
       "head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest\n",
       "Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you,\n",
       "and it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham\n",
       "and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has\n",
       "taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone\n",

       "day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia's short\n",

       "I know not what to think. After making every possible inquiry on that\n",
       "side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing\n",
       "them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but\n",
       "without any success--no such people had been seen to pass through. With\n",
       "the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions\n",
       "to us in a manner most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved\n",
       "for him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame on them. Our\n",
       "distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the\n",
       "worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make\n",
       "it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue\n",
       "their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a\n",
       "young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely, can I suppose\n",
       "her so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that\n",
       "Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his\n",
       "head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to\n",
       "be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and keeps her room. Could she\n",
       "exert herself, it would be better; but this is not to be expected. And\n",
       "as to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has\n",
       "anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of\n",
       "confidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you\n",
       "have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the\n",
       "first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not\n",
       "so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I\n",
       "take up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not; but\n",
       "circumstances are such that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to\n",
       "come here as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well,\n",
       "that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something\n",
       "more to ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel\n",
       "Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I am sure\n",
       "I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any\n",
       "measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to\n",
       "be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence, my\n",
       "uncle's advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will\n",
       "immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! where, where is my uncle?\" cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat\n",

       "a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door it was\n",
       "opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and impetuous\n",

       "she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situation,\n",
       "hastily exclaimed, \"I beg your pardon, but I must leave you. I must find\n",

       "an instant to lose.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Good God! what is the matter?\" cried he, with more feeling than\n",
       "politeness; then recollecting himself, \"I will not detain you a minute;\n",
       "but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are\n",
       "not well enough; you cannot go yourself.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she felt how\n",
       "little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back\n",
       "the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless\n",
       "an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and\n",
       "mistress home instantly.\n",
       "\n",
       "On his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself, and\n",
       "looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,\n",
       "or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,\n",
       "\"Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you\n",
       "present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, I thank you,\" she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. \"There\n",
       "is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; I am only distressed by\n",
       "some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could\n",
       "not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say\n",
       "something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate\n",
       "silence. At length she spoke again. \"I have just had a letter from Jane,\n",
       "with such dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from anyone. My younger\n",
       "sister has left all her friends--has eloped; has thrown herself into\n",
       "the power of--of Mr. Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton.\n",
       "_You_ know him too well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no\n",
       "connections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for ever.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Darcy was fixed in astonishment. \"When I consider,\" she added in a yet\n",
       "more agitated voice, \"that I might have prevented it! I, who knew what\n",
       "he was. Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what I\n",
       "learnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not\n",
       "have happened. But it is all--all too late now.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced\n",

       "wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing\n",
       "consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It\n",
       "was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own\n",
       "wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved\n",
       "him, as now, when all love must be vain.\n",
       "\n",
       "But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia--the\n",
       "humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed\n",
       "up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,\n",
       "Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of\n",
       "several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by\n",
       "the voice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke\n",
       "compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, \"I am afraid you have been\n",
       "long desiring my absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my\n",
       "stay, but real, though unavailing concern. Would to Heaven that anything\n",
       "could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to\n",
       "such distress! But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may\n",
       "seem purposely to ask for your thanks. This unfortunate affair will, I\n",
       "fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley\n",
       "to-day.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy. Say that\n",
       "urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as\n",
       "long as it is possible, I know it cannot be long.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow for\n",
       "her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present\n",
       "reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only\n",
       "one serious, parting look, went away.\n",
       "\n",
       "As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they\n",
       "should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as\n",
       "had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a\n",
       "retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full\n",
       "of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those\n",
       "feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would\n",
       "formerly have rejoiced in its termination.\n",
       "\n",
       "If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's\n",
       "change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if\n",
       "otherwise--if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or\n",
       "unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on\n",
       "a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been\n",
       "exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given\n",
       "somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for Wickham,\n",
       "and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other\n",
       "less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him\n",
       "go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must\n",
       "produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched\n",
       "business. Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained\n",
       "a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,\n",
       "could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least\n",
       "of her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first\n",
       "letter remained in her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that\n",
       "Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry\n",
       "for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared\n",
       "incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment\n",
       "as this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose\n",
       "Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention\n",
       "of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue\n",
       "nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.\n",
       "\n",
       "She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that\n",
       "Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia\n",
       "wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one\n",
       "officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions\n",
       "raised them in her opinion. Her affections had continually been\n",
       "fluctuating but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and\n",
       "mistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did she now\n",
       "feel it!\n",
       "\n",
       "She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to\n",
       "share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a\n",
       "family so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and\n",
       "requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing\n",
       "could be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost\n",
       "importance, and till he entered the room her impatience was severe. Mr.\n",
       "and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant's\n",
       "account that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them\n",
       "instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their\n",
       "summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript\n",
       "of the last with trembling energy.--Though Lydia had never been a\n",
       "favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply\n",
       "afflicted. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the\n",
       "first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner promised every\n",
       "assistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked\n",
       "him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit,\n",
       "everything relating to their journey was speedily settled. They were to\n",
       "be off as soon as possible. \"But what is to be done about Pemberley?\"\n",
       "cried Mrs. Gardiner. \"John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for\n",
       "us; was it so?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.\n",
       "_That_ is all settled.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What is all settled?\" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to\n",
       "prepare. \"And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real\n",
       "truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "But wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her in the\n",
       "hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure\n",
       "to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was\n",
       "impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of\n",
       "business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to\n",
       "be written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their\n",
       "sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.\n",
       "Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing\n",
       "remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of\n",
       "the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could\n",
       "have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.\n",

       "\"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,\" said her uncle, as they\n",
       "drove from the town; \"and really, upon serious consideration, I am much\n",
       "more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does on the\n",
       "matter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should\n",
       "form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or\n",
       "friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I\n",
       "am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends\n",
       "would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the\n",
       "regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is\n",
       "not adequate to the risk!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Do you really think so?\" cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Upon my word,\" said Mrs. Gardiner, \"I begin to be of your uncle's\n",
       "opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and\n",
       "interest, for him to be guilty of. I cannot think so very ill of\n",
       "Wickham. Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe\n",
       "him capable of it?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other\n",
       "neglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I\n",
       "dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been\n",
       "the case?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"In the first place,\" replied Mr. Gardiner, \"there is no absolute proof\n",
       "that they are not gone to Scotland.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such\n",
       "a presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the\n",
       "Barnet road.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, then--supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though\n",
       "for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose. It is\n",
       "not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it\n",
       "might strike them that they could be more economically, though less\n",
       "expeditiously, married in London than in Scotland.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their\n",
       "marriage be private? Oh, no, no--this is not likely. His most particular\n",
       "friend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending\n",
       "to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He\n",
       "cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia--what attraction has she\n",
       "beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake,\n",
       "forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what\n",
       "restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a\n",
       "dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know\n",
       "nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your\n",
       "other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has\n",
       "no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's\n",
       "behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever\n",
       "seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would\n",
       "do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in\n",
       "such a matter.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him\n",
       "as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,\" replied Elizabeth, with\n",
       "tears in her eyes, \"that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such\n",
       "a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say.\n",
       "Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never\n",
       "been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year,\n",
       "nay, for a twelvemonth--she has been given up to nothing but amusement\n",
       "and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle\n",
       "and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.\n",
       "Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,\n",
       "flirtation, and officers have been in her head. She has been doing\n",
       "everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give\n",
       "greater--what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are\n",
       "naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of\n",
       "person and address that can captivate a woman.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But you see that Jane,\" said her aunt, \"does not think so very ill of\n",
       "Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be\n",
       "their former conduct, that she would think capable of such an attempt,\n",
       "till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what\n",
       "Wickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every\n",
       "sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is\n",
       "as false and deceitful as he is insinuating.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And do you really know all this?\" cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity\n",
       "as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I do indeed,\" replied Elizabeth, colouring. \"I told you, the other day,\n",
       "of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you yourself, when last at\n",
       "Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved\n",
       "with such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other\n",
       "circumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to\n",
       "relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From\n",
       "what he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,\n",
       "reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He\n",
       "must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found\n",
       "her.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you\n",
       "and Jane seem so well to understand?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw\n",
       "so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was\n",
       "ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the ----shire\n",
       "was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time. As that was the\n",
       "case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it\n",
       "necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could\n",
       "it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the\n",
       "neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown? And even when it was\n",
       "settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening\n",
       "her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could be\n",
       "in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a\n",
       "consequence as _this_ could ensue, you may easily believe, was far\n",
       "enough from my thoughts.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I\n",
       "suppose, to believe them fond of each other?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either\n",
       "side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware\n",
       "that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first\n",
       "he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all\n",
       "were. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for\n",
       "the first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular\n",
       "attention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and\n",
       "wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment,\n",
       "who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.\"\n",

       "\n",
       "It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added\n",
       "to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by\n",
       "its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during\n",
       "the whole of the journey. From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent.\n",
       "Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could find\n",
       "no interval of ease or forgetfulness.\n",
       "\n",
       "They travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one night\n",
       "on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day. It was a\n",

       "by long expectations.\n",
       "\n",
       "The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing\n",
       "on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock; and, when the\n",
       "carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their\n",
       "faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of\n",
       "capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty kiss,\n",
       "hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down from her\n",
       "mother's apartment, immediately met her.\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the\n",

       "\n",
       "\"And have you heard from him often?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"We have heard only twice. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday to say\n",
       "that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I\n",
       "particularly begged him to do. He merely added that he should not write\n",
       "again till he had something of importance to mention.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And my mother--how is she? How are you all?\"\n",

       "conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were\n",
       "engaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach\n",
       "of the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and\n",

       "good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet\n",
       "deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that\n",

       "\n",
       "\"If I had been able,\" said she, \"to carry my point in going to Brighton,\n",
       "with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia\n",
       "had nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out\n",
       "of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their\n",
       "side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been\n",
       "well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have the\n",
       "charge of her; but I was overruled, as I always am. Poor dear child!\n",
       "And now here's Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham,\n",
       "wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and what is to become\n",

       "shall do.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after\n",
       "general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her\n",
       "that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr.\n",
       "Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Do not give way to useless alarm,\" added he; \"though it is right to be\n",

       "It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more we\n",
       "may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married,\n",
       "and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as\n",
       "lost. As soon as I get to town I shall go to my brother, and make\n",

       "tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them,\n",
       "after they are married. And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting.\n",

       "better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could\n",

       "in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger\n",
       "which she had herself incurred in this business, had given more of\n",
       "fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was\n",

       "Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,\n",

       "most afflicting to a parent's mind. The death of your daughter would\n",
       "have been a blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to\n",

       "uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten\n",
       "thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has children\n",

       "not sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never\n",
       "be requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal\n",
       "protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as\n",
       "years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is\n",
       "actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now,\n",

       "\n",
       "It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood\n",

       "married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its\n",
       "exuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she\n",
       "had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter\n",
       "would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",

       "would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then\n",
       "too late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her\n",

       "latter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with\n",
       "regard to Lydia, at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet\n",
       "could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In\n",
       "terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother,\n",
       "though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect\n",
       "approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the\n",
       "engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed\n",
       "that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would\n",
       "be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present\n",
       "arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the\n",
       "hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket\n",
       "allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her\n",
       "through her mother's hands, Lydia's expenses had been very little within\n",
       "that sum.\n",
       "\n",
       "That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was\n",
       "another very welcome surprise; for his wish at present was to have as\n",
       "little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports\n",
       "of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he\n",
       "naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon\n",
       "dispatched; for, though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick\n",
       "in its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he\n",
       "was indebted to his brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any\n",
       "message to her.\n",
       "\n",
       "The good news spread quickly through the house, and with proportionate\n",
       "speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent\n",
       "philosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage\n",
       "of conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the\n",
       "happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant\n",
       "farmhouse. But there was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the\n",
       "good-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before from\n",
       "all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but a little of their spirit\n",
       "in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband her misery\n",
       "was considered certain.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on this\n",
       "happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in\n",
       "spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her\n",
       "triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object\n",
       "of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of\n",
       "accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those\n",
       "attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and\n",
       "servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a\n",
       "proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering\n",
       "what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and\n",
       "importance.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Haye Park might do,\" said she, \"if the Gouldings could quit it--or the\n",
       "great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is\n",
       "too far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for\n",

       "\n",

       "daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_ house in this\n",
       "neighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the\n",
       "impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm. It\n",
       "soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,\n",
       "that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his\n",
       "daughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of\n",
       "affection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend\n",
       "it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable\n",
       "resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her\n",
       "marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could believe\n",
       "possible. She was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new\n",
       "clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of\n",
       "shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they\n",
       "took place.\n",

       "Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of\n",
       "the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for\n",
       "her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the\n",
       "proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its\n",
       "unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the\n",
       "spot.\n",

       "She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means. There were\n",
       "few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;\n",
       "but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sister's\n",
       "frailty would have mortified her so much--not, however, from any fear\n",
       "of disadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at any rate,\n",
       "there seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia's marriage been\n",
       "concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that\n",
       "Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family where, to every other\n",

       "wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his\n",

       "blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she\n",
       "hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no\n",
       "longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there\n",
       "seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that\n",

       "have been most gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she\n",

       "my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as\n",
       "if she was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in\n",
       "ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed\n",
       "to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never\n",

       "were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you'll believe\n",
       "me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a\n",

       "rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so\n",
       "just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon\n",
       "business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once\n",
       "they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I\n",
       "did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we\n",
       "were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he\n",
       "came back again in ten minutes' time, and then we all set out. However,\n",

       "me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised\n",

       "it was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at\n",
       "her sister's wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,\n",
       "where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.\n",
       "Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her\n",
       "brain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as\n",
       "placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She\n",
       "could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,\n",
       "wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what\n",
       "Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been\n",
       "intended.\n",

       "speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such\n",
       "a time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,\n",
       "for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems\n",

       "hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so\n",
       "dreadfully racked as _yours_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr.\n",
       "Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were,\n",
       "and that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly,\n",
       "Lydia once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day\n",
       "after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for\n",
       "them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to\n",
       "himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known as to\n",
       "make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide\n",
       "in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and\n",
       "confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private\n",
       "actions open to the world. His character was to speak for itself. He\n",
       "called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy\n",
       "an evil which had been brought on by himself. If he _had another_\n",
       "motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him. He had been some days\n",
       "in town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something to\n",
       "direct his search, which was more than _we_ had; and the consciousness\n",
       "of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago\n",
       "governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause\n",
       "of disapprobation, though he did not say what. She then took a large\n",
       "house in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting\n",
       "lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with\n",
       "Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to\n",
       "town. But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he\n",
       "wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and\n",
       "corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found.\n",
       "Wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had\n",
       "she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up\n",
       "their abode with her. At length, however, our kind friend procured the\n",
       "wished-for direction. They were in ---- street. He saw Wickham, and\n",
       "afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His first object with her, he\n",
       "acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful\n",
       "situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed\n",
       "on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But\n",
       "he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared\n",
       "for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear\n",
       "of leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or\n",
       "other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her feelings,\n",
       "it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which,\n",
       "in his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had never\n",
       "been _his_ design. He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment,\n",
       "on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and\n",
       "scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia's flight on her\n",
       "own folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately; and as\n",
       "to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it. He\n",
       "must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have\n",
       "nothing to live on.\n",
       "\n",

       "Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able\n",
       "to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by\n",
       "marriage. But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still\n",
       "cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in\n",
       "some other country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely\n",
       "to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"They met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of\n",

       "reasonable.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy's next step was to\n",
       "make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch\n",
       "street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not be\n",
       "seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father was\n",
       "still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did not judge\n",
       "your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your\n",
       "uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the\n",
       "departure of the former. He did not leave his name, and till the next\n",
       "day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at home,\n",

       "settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to\n",
       "Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that\n",
       "obstinacy is the real defect of his character, after all. He has been\n",
       "accused of many faults at different times, but _this_ is the true one.\n",
       "Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and\n",
       "I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your\n",
       "uncle would most readily have settled the whole.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either\n",
       "the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your uncle\n",
       "was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his\n",
       "niece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,\n",
       "which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter\n",
       "this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation\n",
       "that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where\n",
       "it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane\n",
       "at most.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young\n",
       "people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably\n",
       "more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own\n",
       "settled upon _her_, and his commission purchased. The reason why all\n",
       "this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above. It\n",
       "was owing to him, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that\n",
       "Wickham's character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he\n",
       "had been received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth\n",
       "in _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_ reserve,\n",
       "can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this fine talking,\n",
       "my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would\n",
       "never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for _another\n",
       "interest_ in the affair.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who\n",

       "you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will not\n",
       "afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant\n",
       "admission to the house. _He_ was exactly what he had been, when I\n",
       "knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was\n",
       "satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not\n",

       "home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell\n",
       "you can give you no fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most\n",
       "serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had\n",
       "done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she\n",
       "heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was\n",

       "I _should_ be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect\n",
       "me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes\n",

       "other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial\n",
       "to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming\n",
       "there _with_ his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come\n",
       "without it.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yet it is hard,\" she sometimes thought, \"that this poor man cannot\n",

       "\n",
       "\"No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I\n",

       "nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention\n",

       "Netherfield.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"'Tis an etiquette I despise,\" said he. \"If he wants our society,\n",

       "again.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait\n",
       "on him. But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, I\n",
       "am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will\n",

       "\n",
       "Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her\n",
       "husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her\n",
       "neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before\n",
       "_they_ did. As the day of his arrival drew near,--\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,\" said Jane to her sister. \"It\n",
       "would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can\n",
       "hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;\n",
       "but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she\n",
       "says. Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I wish I could say anything to comfort you,\" replied Elizabeth; \"but it\n",
       "is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction\n",
       "of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have\n",
       "always so much.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,\n",
       "contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety\n",
       "and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could. She counted\n",
       "the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent;\n",
       "hopeless of seeing him before. But on the third morning after his\n",
       "arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window,\n",
       "enter the paddock and ride towards the house.\n",
       "\n",
       "Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely\n",
       "kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went\n",
       "to the window--she looked,--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down\n",
       "again by her sister.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"There is a gentleman with him, mamma,\" said Kitty; \"who can it be?\"\n",

       "\"Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not\n",
       "know.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"La!\" replied Kitty, \"it looks just like that man that used to be with\n",
       "him before. Mr. what's-his-name. That tall, proud man.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of\n",
       "Mr. Bingley's will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must\n",
       "say that I hate the very sight of him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little\n",
       "of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness\n",
       "which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time\n",
       "after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable\n",
       "enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their\n",
       "mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be\n",
       "civil to him only as Mr. Bingley's friend, without being heard by either\n",
       "of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be\n",
       "suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs.\n",
       "Gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.\n",
       "To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused,\n",
       "and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive\n",
       "information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted\n",
       "for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an\n",
       "interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just as\n",
       "what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming--at his\n",
       "coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,\n",
       "was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered\n",
       "behaviour in Derbyshire.\n",
       "\n",
       "The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a\n",
       "minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to\n",
       "her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and\n",
       "wishes must still be unshaken. But she would not be secure.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Let me first see how he behaves,\" said she; \"it will then be early\n",
       "enough for expectation.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to\n",
       "lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of\n",
       "her sister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little\n",
       "paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the\n",
       "gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with\n",
       "tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any\n",
       "symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down\n",
       "again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She\n",
       "had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious, as usual; and,\n",
       "she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as\n",
       "she had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mother's\n",
       "presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but\n",
       "not an improbable, conjecture.\n",
       "\n",
       "Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period\n",
       "saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs.\n",
       "Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,\n",
       "especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of\n",
       "her curtsey and address to his friend.\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter\n",
       "the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy,\n",
       "was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill\n",
       "applied.\n",
       "\n",
       "Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a question\n",
       "which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely anything. He\n",
       "was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but\n",
       "it had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends,\n",
       "when he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed without\n",
       "bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist\n",
       "the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often\n",
       "found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but\n",
       "the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when\n",
       "they last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry\n",
       "with herself for being so.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Could I expect it to be otherwise!\" said she. \"Yet why did he come?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to\n",
       "him she had hardly courage to speak.\n",
       "\n",
       "She inquired after his sister, but could do no more.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,\" said Mrs. Bennet.\n",
       "\n",
       "He readily agreed to it.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People _did_ say\n",
       "you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope\n",
       "it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood,\n",
       "since you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my\n",
       "own daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have\n",
       "seen it in the papers. It was in The Times and The Courier, I know;\n",
       "though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, 'Lately,\n",
       "George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,' without there being a\n",
       "syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.\n",
       "It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to\n",
       "make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth\n",
       "dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could\n",
       "not tell.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,\"\n",
       "continued her mother, \"but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very\n",
       "hard to have her taken such a way from me. They are gone down to\n",
       "Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay\n",
       "I do not know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have\n",
       "heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the\n",
       "regulars. Thank Heaven! he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so\n",
       "many as he deserves.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such\n",
       "misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her,\n",
       "however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually\n",
       "done before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in\n",
       "the country at present. A few weeks, he believed.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,\" said her mother,\n",
       "\"I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please on Mr.\n",
       "Bennet's manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and\n",
       "will save all the best of the covies for you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious\n",
       "attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had\n",
       "flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be\n",
       "hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant, she felt\n",
       "that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for\n",
       "moments of such painful confusion.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The first wish of my heart,\" said she to herself, \"is never more to\n",
       "be in company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure\n",
       "that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either\n",
       "one or the other again!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no\n",
       "compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing\n",
       "how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her\n",
       "former lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little;\n",
       "but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He\n",
       "found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and\n",
       "as unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no\n",
       "difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded\n",
       "that she talked as much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged,\n",
       "that she did not always know when she was silent.\n",
       "\n",
       "When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her\n",
       "intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at\n",
       "Longbourn in a few days time.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,\" she added, \"for when\n",
       "you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with\n",
       "us, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure\n",
       "you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep\n",
       "your engagement.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of\n",
       "his concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.\n",

       "speak to you,\" took her out of the room. Jane instantly gave a look\n",
       "at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her\n",
       "entreaty that _she_ would not give in to it. In a few minutes, Mrs.\n",

       "evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the\n",
       "mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command\n",
       "of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter.\n",
       "\n",

       "returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably\n",
       "persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's\n",
       "concurrence.\n",
       "\n",
       "Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent\n",
       "the morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more\n",
       "agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption\n",
       "or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into\n",
       "silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the\n",
       "other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;\n",
       "and in the evening Mrs. Bennet's invention was again at work to get\n",
       "every body away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter\n",
       "to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea;\n",

       "saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother\n",
       "had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she perceived her\n",
       "sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in\n",
       "earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of\n",
       "both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other, would\n",
       "have told it all. Their situation was awkward enough; but _hers_ she\n",
       "thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and\n",
       "Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as\n",
       "well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few\n",
       "words to her sister, ran out of the room.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give\n",
       "pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest\n",
       "emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.\n",
       "\n",

       "said for the present.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I must go instantly to my mother;\" she cried. \"I would not on any\n",

       "\n",
       "Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease\n",

       "great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen\n",
       "to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections;\n",
       "and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his\n",
       "expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for\n",

       "\n",
       "\"You are a good girl;\" he replied, \"and I have great pleasure in\n",
       "thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your\n",
       "doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are\n",
       "each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so\n",
       "easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will\n",
       "always exceed your income.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be\n",

       "talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely\n",
       "more.\" Then addressing her daughter, \"Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so\n",
       "happy! I am sure I shan't get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it\n",
       "would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not\n",
       "be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when\n",
       "he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was\n",
       "that you should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that\n",
       "ever was seen!\"\n",

       "Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;\n",
       "coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after\n",
       "supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough\n",
       "detested, had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself\n",
       "obliged to accept.\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for\n",
       "while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else;\n",
       "but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours\n",
       "of separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he\n",
       "always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of\n",
       "her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of\n",
       "relief.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He has made me so happy,\" said she, one evening, \"by telling me that he\n",

       "it possible.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I suspected as much,\" replied Elizabeth. \"But how did he account for\n",
       "it?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It must have been his sister's doing. They were certainly no friends to\n",
       "his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have\n",
       "chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,\n",
       "as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will\n",
       "learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we\n",
       "can never be what we once were to each other.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That is the most unforgiving speech,\" said Elizabeth, \"that I ever\n",
       "heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again\n",
       "the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November,\n",

       "indifferent would have prevented his coming down again!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his\n",
       "modesty.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and\n",
       "the little value he put on his own good qualities. Elizabeth was pleased\n",
       "to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend; for,\n",
       "though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she\n",
       "knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.\n",
       "\n",

       "One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been\n",
       "formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the\n",
       "dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the\n",
       "sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up\n",
       "the lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the\n",
       "equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses\n",
       "were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who\n",
       "preceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that\n",
       "somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid\n",
       "the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the\n",
       "shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three\n",
       "continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown\n",
       "open and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\n",
       "\n",
       "They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their\n",
       "astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.\n",

       "inferior to what Elizabeth felt.\n",
       "\n",
       "She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no\n",
       "other reply to Elizabeth's salutation than a slight inclination of the\n",
       "head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her\n",
       "name to her mother on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of\n",
       "introduction had been made.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such\n",
       "high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting\n",

       "\n",
       "\"I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your\n",

       "\n",

       "letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some\n",
       "refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,\n",
       "declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",
       "Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol,\n",
       "attended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the\n",
       "hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and\n",
       "drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent\n",
       "looking rooms, walked on.\n",
       "\n",
       "Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her\n",
       "waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk\n",
       "that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for\n",
       "conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and\n",
       "disagreeable.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How could I ever think her like her nephew?\" said she, as she looked in\n",

       "manner:--\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my\n",
       "journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I\n",
       "come.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to account\n",
       "for the honour of seeing you here.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Miss Bennet,\" replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, \"you ought to\n",
       "know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere _you_ may\n",
       "choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character has ever been\n",
       "celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such\n",
       "moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most\n",
       "alarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told that not only your\n",
       "sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that\n",
       "you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon\n",
       "afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I\n",
       "_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him\n",
       "so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved\n",
       "on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to\n",
       "you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"If you believed it impossible to be true,\" said Elizabeth, colouring\n",
       "with astonishment and disdain, \"I wonder you took the trouble of coming\n",
       "so far. What could your ladyship propose by it?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,\" said Elizabeth\n",
       "coolly, \"will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report\n",
       "is in existence.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"If! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been\n",
       "industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a\n",
       "report is spread abroad?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I never heard that it was.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. You may\n",
       "ask questions which I shall not choose to answer.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his\n",
       "reason. But your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,\n",
       "have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You\n",
       "may have drawn him in.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such\n",
       "language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,\n",
       "and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as this,\n",
       "ever induce me to be explicit.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the\n",
       "presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is\n",
       "engaged to my daughter. Now what have you to say?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will\n",
       "make an offer to me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,\n",
       "they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of\n",
       "_his_ mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles, we planned\n",
       "the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would\n",
       "be accomplished in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of\n",
       "inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to\n",
       "the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his\n",
       "tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of\n",
       "propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his earliest\n",
       "hours he was destined for his cousin?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is\n",
       "no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not\n",
       "be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to\n",
       "marry Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the\n",
       "marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither\n",
       "by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make\n",
       "another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes,\n",
       "Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or\n",
       "friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will\n",
       "be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.\n",
       "Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned\n",
       "by any of us.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"These are heavy misfortunes,\" replied Elizabeth. \"But the wife of Mr.\n",
       "Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily\n",
       "attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause\n",
       "to repine.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude\n",
       "for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that\n",
       "score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came\n",
       "here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will\n",
       "I be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person's\n",
       "whims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"_That_ will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable;\n",
       "but it will have no effect on me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and my\n",
       "nephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal\n",
       "side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable,\n",
       "honourable, and ancient--though untitled--families. Their fortune on\n",
       "both sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of\n",
       "every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?\n",
       "The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections,\n",
       "or fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If you\n",
       "were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere in\n",
       "which you have been brought up.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that\n",
       "sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are\n",
       "equal.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"True. You _are_ a gentleman's daughter. But who was your mother?\n",
       "Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their\n",
       "condition.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Whatever my connections may be,\" said Elizabeth, \"if your nephew does\n",
       "not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady\n",
       "Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a\n",
       "moment's deliberation:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am not.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Lady Catherine seemed pleased.\n",

       "\n",
       "\"I will make no promise of the kind.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more\n",
       "reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that\n",
       "I will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the\n",
       "assurance I require.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into\n",
       "anything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry\n",
       "your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make their\n",
       "marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would\n",
       "my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?\n",
       "Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have\n",
       "supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the\n",
       "application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my character, if\n",
       "you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these. How far your\n",
       "nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs, I cannot tell;\n",
       "but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg,\n",
       "therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the\n",
       "objections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I am\n",
       "no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous\n",
       "elopement. I know it all; that the young man's marrying her was a\n",
       "patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles. And is\n",
       "such a girl to be my nephew's sister? Is her husband, is the son of his\n",
       "late father's steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!--of what are\n",
       "you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You can now have nothing further to say,\" she resentfully answered.\n",
       "\"You have insulted me in every possible method. I must beg to return to\n",

       "for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.\n",

       "\n",
       "\"The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The\n",
       "adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings\n",
       "of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now\n",
       "so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant\n",
       "circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some\n",

       "innocence. But with me, it is not so. Painful recollections will intrude\n",
       "which cannot, which ought not, to be repelled. I have been a selfish\n",
       "being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I\n",
       "was taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I\n",
       "was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.\n",
       "Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only child), I was spoilt\n",

       "would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. But whether she\n",
       "were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it\n",

       "his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be\n",
       "filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her--was a wretched\n",
       "reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,\n",
